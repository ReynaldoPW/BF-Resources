    "MST_SPHERES_818934_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An enchanted shield that belonged to the first Deva Champion who dealt a crushing defeat to the first invading Morokai horde. This legendary artifact has since been passed down from one Champion to another. Even after five hundred years of war, the shield still retains its luster and bears not a single scratch nor dent on it. The technique used to forge the shield was lost to the flames of war when one of their grand forges was razed to the ground. After being named Champion by the Emperor himself, Mikael became the shield's next bearer. Ironically, it had previously been wielded by his beloved brother, a disgraced Champion and branded traitor suspected of fleeing the battlefield.",

To assist them in maintain their libraries, they utilize magical staffs as instruments to move massive shelves from one place to another, or sieve through mountains of scrolls that need sorting. Due to the predicament Allanon brought upon himself, his trusty staff has been customized to be more suited for combat. However, since it uses a mishmash of untested crystals from Myrranthia and Baldemar, Allanon's staff is capable of delivering some rather...unpredictable results. Please use with caution.",

These are the only memento she has left of her sister; a gift for her 3rd birthday. On the day her sister was taken away by the slavers, the bells stopped ringing although they weren't damaged. Not even a rattle could be heard. It was as if the bells took a vow of silence, so they would not attract any unwanted attention. Allanon believes that Nyami's bells were imbued with an ancient power borne from her sister's powerful desire to protect her. The bells are not broken and still \"ring\" to this day, toying with the minds of those who harbor any ill intent towards its master.",

It took the combined effort of the members of Rih'alnase to crack open the belly of one such turtle, which mistook the curious Librarian for it's dinner. Having earned the respect and trust of Rih'alnase, the gemstone has been bestowed upon a summoner who has earned the respect and trust of the wondering band of misfits. ",

    "MST_SPHERES_819189_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A Flower of the Vale corrupted by Void energy. The blight that penetrates these flowers is a desecration of its original life essence, and yet, their auras appear curiously similar\u2014like two sides of the same coin.<br><br>The Voidborn's vile influence seeped into the fertile soil of the Vale, corrupting every living organism it touched. When the creeping blight tainted these flowers, they took on a poisonous, amaranthine hue instead of wilting.<br><br>Perhaps the nature of the blight\u2014or the flower\u2014is not all it seems.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819190_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A Flower of the Vale tinged with Faefire. Although the original flowers were said to be delicate and fragile, the divine nature of Faefire has imbued them with a fiery essence instead of burning the bloom to ash.<br><br>During the Voidborn invasion, vast trails of destruction marked the once peaceful Vale, but one particular section was found razed with Faefire\u2014damning evidence of Man's theft and betrayal of this divine power.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819191_LONGDESCRIPTION":"With such a cold name, this trinket puts most people off from procuring it for fear of contracting frostbite or worse. However, those brave enough to handle the item hear faint strains of old melodies emanating from it, as well as a nostalgic warmth.<br><br>A closer inspection of the trinket reveals an inset, indicating that something else is needed to complete this trinket.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819192_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An odd trinket with several musical notes hovering inside. It exudes a small aura of coldness that seems to be at odds with its appearance.

    "MST_SPHERES_819193_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A completed trinket formed from both Kindling and Frigid Melodies. It exudes a warm and invigorating aura comparable to a blazing fireplace. The trinket grants its wielder an increase in strength, and allows them to withstand punishment that would have otherwise crippled an average person.<br><br>When held, twin sensations of warm and cold dance across the fingertips. This trinket seems to be the manifestation of a will to protect those who brave many hardships.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819194_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A precious emerald so named for its rare crystallization structure that causes five colors to reflect instead of the single, standard deep green. Such gems are highly prized in the market, and are a popular inset in all sorts of jewelry.<br><br>According to the ancients, five key elements were instrumental to the creation of the universe: fire, water, thunder, earth, and a fifth combined essence said to be the harmony between light and dark. Some geologists believe that the quintan emerald, in displaying these colors, can be seen as a microcosm of the universe.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819196_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An amazing lucky charm that provides not only protection for the wearer but also grants them additional confidence to overcome obstacles. Such charms are normally impossible to be crafted and fragments of these charms only be found by answering a series of questions from the guests of another world.<br><br>Legend has it that these guests rarely appear. The only way to encounter them is by standing at a certain location where the stars and moons align, and even then, one must still be incredibly lucky to chance upon them.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819197_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An ornate golden longbow belonging to Andaria, mistress of the hunt and of history. Its incredible draw appears to require prodigious strength, but instead relies on the wielder's dexterity and technique rather than brute force. Andaria strongly believed that the end goal of any hunt should be a dance between equals, and not merely that of hunter and hunted.<br><br>Andaria favored swiftness and patience above all, and during the Augmentation Wars, it was said that the last visual registered on many of Gazia's robots was a single, gleaming streak of gold.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819198_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A vibrant, prismatic flower that grows only in the Vale of the North under certain conditions. It gives off a gentle, aromatic scent at full bloom, and its petals appear to glitter and glow at night. Among the Fae, it is a popular gift of friendship among children and adults alike, but it is far more sought after by human druids and scholars.<br><br>Surviving botanical records from Hanukkah festivals during the Vale's brief period of open contact note the flower's many beneficial properties, among them an incredible boost to one's magical abilities.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819199_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A gleaming golden pupa of the rare chrys\u00f3s butterfly, a mythological emblem of glory and power. According to a popular legend, these chrysalises contain tiny sparks of life that will protect its bearer from violent misfortune.<br>Chrysalises that are especially tough and resilient are known as \"Alphas\", and are presented as gifts to soldiers and warriors. The butterflies that emerge from these gilded pupae are resistant to extremes of heat and cold, and their wings often feature large, intimidating patterns.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819200_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A stunning silver pupa of the rare chrys\u00f3s butterfly, a mythological emblem of glory and power. According to a popular legend, these chrysalises contain tiny sparks of life that will protect its bearer from violent misfortune.<br>Chrysalises that are found deep in lush forests or in the wake of fertile rains are known as \"Omegas\", and are presented as gifts to sentinels and guards.

    "MST_SPHERES_819201_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A highly unusual azure pupa of the rare chrys\u00f3s butterfly, a mythological emblem of glory and power. According to a popular legend, these chrysalises contain tiny sparks of life that will protect its bearer from violent misfortune.<br>Chrys\u00f3s caterpillars that form azure chrysalises are said to combine the best traits of both the golden Alpha and silver Omega variants. Known as \"Zetas\", the butterflies that emerge from these pupae are paragons of the species. Zetas are usually presented as gifts to monarchs and heroes, as they possess powerful energies that invigorate the body.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819202_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Forged from fire and fury itself, the spear of the great demigod warrior Ultor is every bit as unbreakable as his will. As Athensphere's mightiest champion, Ultor led their armies to countless victories, crushing all who stood in their path.<br><br>At the height of the Augmentation Wars, Ultor was a permanent sight on the burning battlefields. His battle roars were overshadowed only by each earth-shaking swing of this indestructible spear. Legends say that the demigod single-handedly downed enough enemies to fill a small empire, his eyes burning with the passion of conquest.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819203_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A mighty spear fashioned after a thunderbolt, symbol of the great demigod leader Zedus. It was said that the power of the old gods manifested as a ravaging thunderstorm upon the newly created world of Athensphere\u2014\"the light that streaks the path of all things.\"<br><br>Zedus fought valiantly and selflessly in the Augmentation Wars, channeling all of his power into every strike of his spear. During his final stand to ensure the evacuation of his people, his gleaming form silhouetted against the smog-choked sky evoked the image of a divine pillar of light smiting evil.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819204_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Solemn and stalwart, this trident is the chosen weapon of Tridon, Grand Admiral of the Athensphere navy. Its three-pronged tip channeled the power of the oceans into raging maelstroms, and yet in the same vein, it was also capable of calming the most irate tides.<br><br>Though Tridon was peaceable and preferred the expansion of trade and commerce over military might, he came to the forefront of Athensphere's defense during the Augmentation Wars. His love for the people was second only to Zedus, and it was through his efforts that many were afforded the chance to evacuate.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819206_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Developed by Vektor, the Excelsior Chip is a modular enchancement for robotic equipment or entities outfitted with the standard XSB-U sockets. This MK-1 chip is an initial prototype of the series, and the very same that propelled him into world of engineering.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819207_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Developed by Vektor, the Excelsior Chip MK-2 is a significant improvement over the MK-1, boasting improvements in every area and adding several new functions for compatible robotic equipment and entities. The MK-2 was the result of countless hours of iteration, mostly due to Vektor wanting \"a bigger bang.\" This chip is popular on the market, especially among fighting robot enthusiasts.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819208_LONGDESCRIPTION":"At the peak of the Excelsior Chip line stands the MK-3, Vektor's pride and joy. Although the series is designed with all robotic equipment and entities in mind, the MK-3 itself is specifically tailored to enhance the battle android Galene's abilities. One could say it is Vektor's way of expressing his love for Galene, despite the strangeness of romance between a human and what many would call a sentient pile of circuits and wires.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819210_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A grisly, impaled skull with tentacles erupting from its mandible, the Uln'gha is the cherished relic of Saerenthis, high priest of the Endless Abyss.<br><br>This was the skull of the high priest's own father, whom he personally sacrificed to gain favor with their Deep Goddess. This symbolic act was meant to sever all earthly relationships, so that he would wholly devote himself to carrying out Tsovinar's will.<br><br>The Uln'gha appears to have a will of its own at times, and has been known to utter smatterings of eldritch or abyssal phrases.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819211_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A massive blade that is extremely unwieldy to all but the strongest and nimblest of warriors, it bears an uncanny resemblance to another famous sword known as the \"Duster Sword\".<br><br>Before the fateful battle between Shura and Hisui, this weapon was the bane of many great warriors. Though it is crafted from common steel, it shines radiantly with the focus and ambition of its former master. When Shura forsook his name to become the War Demon Shusui, he abandoned his weapon as well, leaving it to be discovered by the Summoner's Hall in an unnamed corner of Celgrad.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819212_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A heavy, iridescent longsword, with intricate weaving patterns carved into the side of the blade.<br><br>This is Noel's second attempt to replicate a weapon carried by the War Demon Shusui. Recognising that his berserker fury was Shusui's shortcoming in battle, Noel was careful to dampen the furious aura that emanated from its previous incarnation. The weapon has lost none of its potency, however, and preliminary tests have unveiled the ability to absorb magical strength from its wielder's foes.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819213_LONGDESCRIPTION":"The ultimate weapon. Its power exceeds those of anything once wielded by War Demon Shusui.<br><br>Along with Giselle's unerringly helpful insight, Noel has fashioned a close quarters weapon that changes form at its user's will. However, it requires enormous energy to sustain its form at all times, and only entities with great mental fortitude have the stamina to use such a weapon. Noel believes that this weapon will enable anybody who is strong enough to wield it to become the next War Demon.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819214_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An unassuming metal half-mask, it grants the wearer extraordinary vision of the magics and energies that permeate all things.<br><br>With an improved understanding of magical neural interfaces, Noel has overhauled the way it communicates with the user, removing the unintended side effect of vegetation by long-term use. Noel's testers have, however, reported slight migraines and nausea after extended periods of use, presumably due to the average mind's inability to handle extreme clarity and detail.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819215_LONGDESCRIPTION":"The ultimate soothsayer. In addition to magical vision, its user is endowed with multiple visions of possible events in the near future. Only entities with great mental strength are capable of wearing this device and using it effectively instead of going insane. Noel says it is theoretically possible for a user to focus the mask's power into one single chain of events to see far into its future, but he has yet to find anyone who can.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819216_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An improved version of Mordlim's shield. It creates an endless weave of interlocking branches and twigs around the wearer.<br><br>The shield has been upgraded to absorb and store vast amounts of solar energy, used to grow a wooden armor around its bearer. The wood is deceptively strong, as resilient as the best materials used in Noel's defensive technologies. In the rare case of the armor getting damaged in combat, the shield immediately regenerates the wood, as long as there is energy left.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819217_LONGDESCRIPTION":"The apex of nature's defense. Noel has added a battery meter to inform the bearer when it is time to charge the armor.<br><br>In addition to maintaining a solid defense, the shield is now able to power up the wearer's strength and stamina. Some describe the experience as a powerful force of nature.<br><br>Its rudimentary sentience occasionally manifests as a soft whisper coming from the shield itself: \"I have root!\" Interpretations of this simple sentence vary, but the most popular and accepted one is that the armor as declared its host as part of itself\u2014the source of its energy and something to protect.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819218_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A complicated looking suit of armor that is actually quite simple to put on.<br><br>Before Noel could even begin designing upgrades for Beiorg's Armor, its components assimilated Orebi crystals close by and started modifying itself. Having wanted to incorporate technology from some research blueprints that the summoner \"borrowed\" from a corporation in some distant land, Noel attempted to assuage his bruised ego by undoing the automated upgrades. The armor refused.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819219_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An extremely futuristic piece of protective technology, created when Beiorg's Armor is exposed to sufficiently large Orebi crystals. Its array of defensive capabilities include an exhaustive arsenal of preemptive mechanisms, automated by the powerful and cognizant Artificial Intelligence residing in the armor. Having recognized the envious Noel as a worthy adversary in an unsanctioned arms race, the armor upgraded itself several times over in a single iteration.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819220_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A flawlessly clear orb that resembles an eye. Its ley lines shift and transform at the will of the wielder. A black ellipse at the center of the orb, like the pupil of an eye, swivels around merrily as if pleased. After consuming considerable amounts of Orebi crystals, the orb attained its current form, refusing to absorb any more magic. Noel noted that he could no longer detect the subtle malevolence that previously seeped out from the orb. Noel believes that the orb has a sentience of its own\u2014one that seeks to siphon latent energy from its user, and suggests caution when handling it for long periods of time.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819221_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A white orb emanating magic so potent that it manifests as visible ley lines around the orb. The mock Twilight Stone lost its signature blue aura when infused with magical Orebi essence. This orb synchronizes its own attacks with the user, multiplying the effects tenfold. After countless hours spent trying to understand the inner workings of this orb, Noel hypothesized that Mora's lust for power was slowly and secretly deepened by her Twilight Stone, despite her immense willpower. As for how or why, he has yet to figure out.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819222_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A red jewel set in a golden frame. Its lavish yet pleasant style belies the awesome power held within. After saturating the armor with Orebi magic, most of the suit disappeared into thin air, leaving behind the chestplate seal. When the user places the seal on any part of the body, a suit of armor magically materializes around the user, with none of its magical and physical strength diminished. Noel has yet to find a reason for its immateriality, but most Summoners find its easily concealable nature a boon for surprise encounters.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819223_LONGDESCRIPTION":"You can't quite place your eyes on it. Are you seeing double? Triple? Which seal is the real one? The morning after Noel infused even more potent magic into the Bulwark of Menon, he came into his laboratory to find hundreds of seals lying everywhere. Each copy seemed as real as the original\u2014he spent weeks identifying the real seal, and kept it marked to prevent such tedious work again. Wearers of the seal gain the ability to clone several copies of themselves to confuse and swarm the enemy in battle. Fighting a foe with such an advantage was, at best, a tedious affair; and at worst, an overpowering loss.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819224_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Though cracked in several places, this pulsing orb still retains much of the power of a Revenant\u2014a Guardian that has consumed so much debris that its phantom essence exhibits anomalous energy signals. It was theorized that these Guardians were abandoned decades ago by long-dead Guilds.<br><br>After several tests by Noel and Giselle, the energy signals are similar to pulses in the human brain when accessing memories. The Revenants are thus named for being amalgamations of \"deceased memories\", but whether this is scientific fact or supernatural sentiment is a constant topic of debate between them.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819225_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A little something from Giselle as thanks for all the hard work you've been doing for the Orebus Special Inquiry lately.<br><br>It is well known through history that a lady's kiss is a sign of affectionate\u2014even intimate\u2014favor, but what is baffling is just how she managed to get this to you. Catching a blown kiss is a figure of speech, not a reality-bending, science-defying feat. And yet, here it is, taking up an invisible space in your hand. You can even see her mischievous smile if you close your eyes and focus hard enough.<br><br>Lucky you...?",
    "MST_SPHERES_819226_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Gleaming scale gauntlets boasting impressive rock knuckles and clawed fingers.<br><br>Noel created these fist weapons by imbuing dragonscale with the raw magic of Orebi Revenants. There are only a few of these in existence as the magical process used to craft them is prone to failure, utterly destroying the materials involved...as well as anybody standing too close, as Noel nearly found out. Forget spears or bows, dragon hunters would do anything to get their hands on a pair of these rockstars.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819227_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A flashing orb containing all the colors that exist in the visible light spectrum. In life, Melord had been turned into various forms, and his core contained magical memories detailing the shapeshifting process. On a whim, Giselle analyzed the magic involved, allowing Noel to apply the concept to a whole range of magical beasts. Powerful entities are able to access these forms within the orb, turning into 72 possible transformations as the situation demands.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819228_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A heavy onyx faceplate belonging to Czorag, a member of the Seventh Circle Fiends. The rune inscribed on the forehead is a remarkably modern take on the ancient rituals normally used to contact demonic entities.<br><br>Czorag differs from most of the other mercenaries in one key aspect: he seems to be a native inhabitant of their hellish plane. The heated inner surface suggests a body temperature too high for any normal human.<br><br>Rarely known to remove his faceplate, one can only imagine the sheer malice on Czorag's undoubtedly frightful visage, given his prodigious appetite for destruction.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819229_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Crafted from fine steel and accented with gold bronze, this modern-looking helm belongs to Katerin, one of the Seventh Circle Fiends. The rune on the visor resembles sigils used in demonic rituals.<br><br>Katerin was a tormented soul whose misery extended beyond her death. Among the meagre possessions she haunted as a wraith, none held as much sentimentality as this helm. Though it has been reworked and improved upon over the decades, it unfortunately does nothing to lessen the cruel whispers that fill her mind.<br><br>Perhaps playing the part of executioner is both a curse and a blessing to her.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819230_LONGDESCRIPTION":"This vulpine trinket is a cherished possession of Hakuzo, a mercenary of the Seventh Circle Fiends. A ring of foreign runes, said to be from a forgotten land of warrior monks and wandering swordsmen, glows around it. Hakuzo has a rather foxish demeanor about him, from his sharp eyes to the bushy tail affixed upon his wide-brimmed hat.<br><br>Many tales from his supposed land of origin speak of shapeshifting animals, foxes the most notorious among them.<br><br>Though some foxes there are messengers of a god, many more simply prefer to assume the appearance of their divine brethren for their own ends.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819231_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An emblem resembling a sharp-beaked corvid, insignia of Vr\u00e1na's former house. It crackles with arcane energy, forming a faint aura of bright blue bolts and golden sigils.<br><br>Vr\u00e1na's natural aptitude for arcana manifested in her talent for manabreaking\u2014disrupting the mana flow of a magic-user, and in severe cases, incapacitation and death.<br><br>The young heiress begrudges her selfish parents for pawning her soul while she was in the blush of youth, but since finding her place among the Seventh Circle Fiends, has grown fond of her new kin. A noble, after all, must have a place of pride.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819232_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A bronzed skull artifact brimming with a potent curse, a keepsake from Tarok's personal collection. Painted on its forehead are ritual runes from an ancient, forgotten civilization.<br><br>Tarok viewed his ill-starred existence as both a curse foisted upon him, as well as a blessing to be elevated at the whims of the gods. Savagery was the only way to survive in a world painted red by tooth and claw, and yet there was reverence to be found even in the thrill of the hunt.br><br>Having accepted his role in the grand machinations of his dark deity, Tarok prowls the planes, seeking his next trophy.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819234_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A charming, well-crafted hairclip of unknown metal belonging to Giselle. The eerie emerald gem set prominently at its base seems to reflect your bewildered gaze.<br><br>You're not quite sure why such an innocuous item would provoke anxiety, but suddenly, you hear it: vague strains of flutes playing the same thin, monotonous note, accompanied by a slow drumbeat that seems to mimic the living pulse of something far beyond your knowledge.<br><br>Giselle, you think, is truly a woman of mystery... Though, at this point, you're starting to wonder if she was ever human to begin with.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819235_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A plasma-activated device used to greatly enhance one's agility. The tubes within the wheel contain frigid plasma which irradiates bodies in its vicinity. Possessing this wheel allows one to slow down time itself.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819236_LONGDESCRIPTION":"The heirloom held by the Yasakani clan, it was used in a powerful rite to seal the power of Orochi. A jewel of divine shape and form, it is revealed only to a select few, yet many covet the power and prestige that it holds.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819237_LONGDESCRIPTION":"The heirloom held by the Yata clan, it was used in a powerful rite to seal the power of Orochi. A mirror that can create illusions, it is held by its wielder close to her heart while many covet the power and prestige that it holds.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819238_LONGDESCRIPTION":"The heirloom held by the Kusanagi clan, it was used in a powerful rite to seal the power of Orochi. A majestic sword of impressive proportions, its true form is known only to a select few, yet many covet the power and prestige that it holds.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819239_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A cacophony of voices fills the user's mind, roaring with battle rage. It is as though the blade is infused with souls that believe they are still fighting on battlefields long destroyed.<br><br>Giselle recommends that Summoners take frequent breaks when using this item, lest the voices become indistinguishable from one's own. <br><br>A swordsman with extraordinary clarity is able to discern an occasional shriek: \"Khree!\"",
    "MST_SPHERES_819240_LONGDESCRIPTION":"This orb gives off a comfortably warm aura, embracing and entertaining nearby listeners with an enjoyable song.<br><br>Lost in the raging tides of Orebus' constant wars, lovers cling closely and tentatively to each other. Attachment to other beings was frowned upon by society and feared by individuals, as existence on Orebus was generally... rather transient. However, those who did take the plunge into relationships were rewarded beyond their wildest dreams with a hitherto unencountered sense of satisfaction.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819241_LONGDESCRIPTION":"This seal emanates waves of remorse, with a sobbing that is barely detectable even in a quiet place. The sounds evoke a person choking back their tears in the dark of a night, knowing that the dire present and desolate future are nothing more than the accumulation of their past mistakes.<br><br>A strong Summoner learns a crucial lesson from the seal to avoid letting past mistakes force their hand into making new ones; a weak Summoner allows themselves to be paralysed by indecision and second-guessing, overwhelmed by the power of regret.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819242_LONGDESCRIPTION":"The Artificial Intelligence within the armor has grown even more active after absorbing the Whispering Shard. It beeps and whistles every so often, as if trying to communicate with the wearer.<br><br>The Greherd of Orebus were well known for their disposition towards technology, and a significant portion of their population and resources were focused towards all sorts of research fields. It seems that death did nothing to diminish these scientists' passions, and their souls gravitated to Beiorg's successor.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819243_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Anyone who wears this mask hears only a mournful choir, filled with sorrow over an unknown catastrophe. The elegy seemed to be about an event that had yet to occur, however -- foreseen, tragic, and inevitable.<br><br>Some Summoners have been known to enjoy its lamentations, treating it as a sort of ominous entertainment or grim prophecy.<br><br>Advanced meditation may help soothsayers discern the image of a looming fleet of shining golden shapes against a midnight sky.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819244_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Upon donning the armor, an almost deafening silence is immediately apparent. The story of the nomads of Orebus is one told in hushed tones. Unwilling to join any of the six factions of Orebus, countless tribes of nomads hid themselves away.<br><br>From the raging wars between the factions and the golden ships from beyond the limits of the sky, to the golems and their pointless wars, the nomads had seen it all.<br><br>Though many died, the remainder clung desperately to life. Generations of silence had bred noise out of the race, and it was the faint hope of peace in a distant future that kept the nomads going.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819245_LONGDESCRIPTION":"You have no idea what this object is supposed to look like. It has no shape, yet it has a million shapes. It has no color, but it contains the entire spectrum of light. Noel tells you that his brain and yours are both unable to comprehend the object, and that other mortals would probably see even less. Is it made of matter? Does it matter?<br><br>This sphere contains many brave souls who fought to the very end for their commanders. Holding it bolsters the user's resolve tenfold, and combat leaders are able to use its power to sharpen the fighting spirit of their subordinates.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819246_LONGDESCRIPTION":"Among the nomads and warrior monks of the Southern Plateaus, the concept of a \"guardian spirit\"\u2014a s\u00fclde\u2014is strongly rooted in their culture of ancestor worship. Every individual possesses one from birth, and this protective force stays with them for life.<br><br>Rarely, a s\u00fclde can manifest physically when an object or idol is consecrated to it. Jeweled beads are favored by Southern folk for their versatility as worn jewelry and as a convenient home should the s\u00fclde choose to make its presence known.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819247_LONGDESCRIPTION":"The highest form a s\u00fclde\u2014an individual's guardian spirit\u2014can ascend to is that of tengri, the most powerful class of divinities in the beliefs of the Southern nomads. Qormusta was the chief god and leader of the tengri; those directly under its command invoke its name as an indication of class and status.<br><br>Most souls are imbalanced to some degree, but Saskya's dark desires had overwhelmed her gentle nature since her first taste of conflict. Only by keeping both light and darkness in equilibrium can an individual find harmony in a perfect self.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819248_LONGDESCRIPTION":"A decorative headpiece belonging to Inoko, one of the twelve heavenly creatures sent to the earthly realm to compete in Emperor Yu's search for the perfect assistant.<br><br>Boar was most proud of her tusks, but after learning that humans saw her kind as crude beasts, she decided to adopt conventional standards of beauty. Inoko did not abandon them completely, however; the brash beauty had them fashioned into a stunning headpiece, which remains one of her favorite accessories and a surefire way to get the crowd talking.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819249_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An imposing crown belonging to Inoko, a celestial boar who assumed the gorgeous form of a voluptuous woman and became a fiery fashionista who turned heads wherever she went.<br><br>As Inoko's taste for fashion grew, so did her vanity. Unlike some, Inoko had no qualms defending her pride with the ire of her true self. The great curved tusks atop her perfect coiffure were a symbol of that fierce nature.<br><br>It's generally a bad idea to get into a shouting match with this beastly beauty, but her friends maintain she is, at her heart, fiercely sincere.",
    "MST_SPHERES_819250_LONGDESCRIPTION":"An experimental liquid prepared by Charlie, one of twelve heavenly creatures sent to the earthly realm to prove themselves the most worthy of being Emperor Yu's trusted assistant in a competition.<br><br>Rat was both curious and clever, rapidly scurrying from idea to idea. She delved deep into the secrets of science, and before long, had set up a laboratory to test out every sort of formula she could get her hands on.

Living and dying by her talons, the celestial rooster's victories are a tour de force to be reckoned with.<br><br>While Kelsa's forays into the ring were more out of a personal calling to put down ruffians than for any showmanship, her bouts drew a massive crowd and greater appreciation for the sport\u2014both a blessing and a curse.
