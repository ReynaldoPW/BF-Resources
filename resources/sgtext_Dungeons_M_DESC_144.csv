    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10070_DESCRIPTION":"The gigantic tower might as well be a skyscraper piercing the sea of clouds. Could its candle-like branches be the stronghold of a demon?",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10073_DESCRIPTION":"No matter how you think of it, what Shusui says makes little sense. Why is he testing you? You can't read the demon's mind at all.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10074_DESCRIPTION":"You can feel a great power ahead, but it doesn't belong to a demon. Could it be Shusui's last trial? Better prepare yourself before proceeding.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10075_DESCRIPTION":"An entirely different enemy than any of the ones the fallen heroes before you ever faced is expecting you at the top of the tower. Shusui awaits.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10141_DESCRIPTION":"You head towards the Ruins in search of Seria and Lugina. Now that Paris is not around, walking behind the silent Mora doesn't feel right.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10142_DESCRIPTION":"A bad feeling overcomes you. A sharp, blood thirsty will made of pure evil draws near. There's nowhere to run, so prepare a good counterattack.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10143_DESCRIPTION":"Just how far did Paris go? You can't pick up any presences around you, but whatever you encounter will not be weak. It would be good to regroup.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10144_DESCRIPTION":"Things are happening so suddenly, there is no time to react. What could Mora be thinking? There's no time to ponder about that either.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1014_DESCRIPTION":"A wielder of ice magic carrying a terrifying axe stands in your way. A fierce battle is about to start, but make it quick. The snowfield's exit is near.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101500_DESCRIPTION":"Celebrate the New Year in this special once a day dungeon! We hope you enjoy all we have in store this year for Brave Frontier!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10150_DESCRIPTION":"After being apart for such a long time, you reunite with Seria and Lugina. Now you must begin all preparations necessary to face Mora once again.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10151_DESCRIPTION":"The black rocks and red lava remind you of the first caverns you passed through. It's not that hot here, but you're thrown off by the ominous miasma.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10152_DESCRIPTION":"A bad feeling once again. You've felt this countless times by now, this evil intent to kill. And combined with the miasma, chills run down your spine.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10153_DESCRIPTION":"When you look behind you, it seems as if all the land were illuminated by lightning. Perhaps it's the dragon's suffering. A long bridge stands ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10154_DESCRIPTION":"After climbing down a steep hill, you grow closer to the great bridge. The miasma around you makes everything creepier as it points towards the enemy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101600_DESCRIPTION":"Celebrate the New Year in this special once a day dungeon! We hope you enjoy all we have in store this year for Brave Frontier!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10160_DESCRIPTION":"The demon Mora finally reveals her true identity. She says that if you wish to know Karl's whereabouts, you must defeat her first. Can you trust her?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10161_DESCRIPTION":"Crossing the great bridge with Lugina reminds you of your time in Lizeria. With that in mind you wonder how your relationship has made it this far.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10162_DESCRIPTION":"Thanks to Paris and Lugina's help, you won't face many traps along the way. But the demons Mora has sent come at you one after another.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10163_DESCRIPTION":"You may have beaten a disciple, but its presence is not completely gone. Countless disciple-like demons come after you, but you're only halfway there.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10164_DESCRIPTION":"It's battle after battle, but while caught up in them you feel a new,  yet strange power approaching. It feels familiar somehow though...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10165_DESCRIPTION":"After defeating Shusui anew, you head towards the end of the bridge. However, you feel that demonic presence again. You know which demon awaits now.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101700_DESCRIPTION":"The Six Sibyl Sisters were said to have rescued many people. Here lays a shrine dedicated to one of them. Why was it they reached out to save the people?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101701_DESCRIPTION":"The Blaze Sibyl saved the people with an affectionate heart of mercy. However, that in turn led to her fighting her sisters. The sadness from that fight still lingers.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10170_DESCRIPTION":"The demon Mora suddenly appears before you again. What is a demon's shadow? And just what could be going on in Ishgria?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101800_DESCRIPTION":"The ice cold air pricks at your skin, but what awaits ahead is a sibyl said to have a glacial glare even colder than ice.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101801_DESCRIPTION":"A blade of ice that shines clear and bright thanks to the blood of the people it has fed on. Perhaps this is a symbol of her true pure nature. ",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101900_DESCRIPTION":"The land that was once covered with beautiful blossoming flowers now exists as a dark, cold place, just like the memories of the young Rose Sibyl.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101901_DESCRIPTION":"The young Rose Sibyl was best known for her sweet childlike smile. But do not underestimate her, for pure innocence and pure ruthlessness are two sides of the same coin.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102000_DESCRIPTION":"The sisters once chatted joyfully in the land of thunder. Now, not a trace of their happiness can be found.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102001_DESCRIPTION":"Do these bolts of lightning represent the rage of a sibyl of destruction, or are they her tears, shed over the battle with her sisters? The truth will never be known.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10200_DESCRIPTION":"The lava before you makes you falter a little. No matter how many trying places you've visited, you'll need resolve to get out of this one.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10201_DESCRIPTION":"The air carries the fiery breath of a dragon. There's no doubt that a group of them is nearby. Best move quietly to avoid any confrontations.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10202_DESCRIPTION":"It's so hot you want to resort to Lugina's rude vocabulary to describe the temperature. Your skin stings too, perhaps because you're a bit burnt?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10203_DESCRIPTION":"The sound of the lava flow is unexpectedly pleasant, until you suddenly hear a deafening roar. It might be smart to prepare for battle.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10204_DESCRIPTION":"This hell-like lava path seems to be almost over. However, menacing presences still lurk about. Could this be the demon's assassins?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1020_DESCRIPTION":"The verdant ocean of trees lives up to its name. Wherever you look, the sun's rays are blocked by lush greenery. Under your feet, the ground is covered in grass and moss.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102100_DESCRIPTION":"This sparkling shrine was once the pride of the Six Sisters. Now, without a master, rampant monsters lurk in alongside the souls of the sibyls of destruction.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102101_DESCRIPTION":"The sibyl who had the kindness and mercy to forgive all sins, yet she couldn't save those closest to her. What might she reveal to a Summoner able to capture her?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10210_DESCRIPTION":"Very impactful scenery suddenly comes into view. A deep red sea spreads before your eyes. Its hue makes you realize anew you're in another world.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10211_DESCRIPTION":"Though the sea has a red tint to it, its smell is not strange at all. This disparity makes you uncomfortable and highly confuses you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10212_DESCRIPTION":"You've seen the sea dyed by the colors of the sunset before, but you're sure this water's hue is something entirely different. You start feeling sick.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10213_DESCRIPTION":"The \"Six Armors\" that Mora mentioned, which rival demonic powers, start to bug you. You may have to fight them in the future.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10214_DESCRIPTION":"Are all of Ishgria's oceans red? While thinking that to yourself, a horde of enemies shows up. This is no time to take it easy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1021_DESCRIPTION":"Unlike the tundra, the forest is full of what looks like landmarks. But they are starting to lead you astray as you trip over the thick grass.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102200_DESCRIPTION":"The shrine sparkles like a star scattered sky. Just like the night sky it is breathtaking yet terrifying, awakening one's primal fear of the dark. ",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102201_DESCRIPTION":"She was too engrossed in pursuing her ideals which is why she couldn't forgive anything. Regardless the passage of time, this never changed.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10220_DESCRIPTION":"Seria was right. This place really doesn't resemble a laboratory. However, if you look closely you'll see a lot of strange equipment.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10221_DESCRIPTION":"The ruins turned laboratory are being swallowed by the forest. You can feel great vitality coming from the plants growing along the walls.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10222_DESCRIPTION":"Even though the facility has been eroded by the forest, a part of it still seems to be alive. The science behind it was indeed efficient.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10223_DESCRIPTION":"A very misplaced and dense floral aroma drifts in the air. You still don't know much about Ishgria's nature, so you would do well to be cautious.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10224_DESCRIPTION":"You're almost out of the laboratory, but Lugina and Paris are still nowhere to be seen. Seria's also taken her own path, so just keep moving forward.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1022_DESCRIPTION":"All of a sudden, sunshine bathes you as the old growth gives way to young foliage. The fresh flowers are a pleasure to your senses.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10230_DESCRIPTION":"As something fearsome drops from the heavens and comes after you, you realize there is no room to talk. The battle has already started.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10231_DESCRIPTION":"The strong wind doesn't cease blowing. The wood of the gigantic and heavy windmill towering over you makes a loud creaking noise as it turns.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10232_DESCRIPTION":"The strong wind may be somewhat depressing, but at least it's neither too hot nor too cold. There's no apparent danger in sight either.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10233_DESCRIPTION":"A violent squall almost sent you flying. Looks like this is yet another place where you can't let your guard down. Be careful.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10234_DESCRIPTION":"Though the windmill seems pretty old, it is still in very good condition, and even mobile. Could this have been the energy source for the lab?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1023_DESCRIPTION":"You happen upon an old tree that manages to stand out in the ocean of its peers. Though not much taller than the others, it is far wider. You must make your way around it.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10240_DESCRIPTION":"Beiorg shows himself before you again. Would it be wise to fight this enemy with a function that makes him stronger after every defeat?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10241_DESCRIPTION":"While looking at the landscape you realize that both demons and humans must have lived here long ago. Could humans really have inhabited Ishgria?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10242_DESCRIPTION":"After passing numerous alleys on a hill, you finally find the main road. However, where could the inhabitants of such a great city have gone?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10243_DESCRIPTION":"When you turn on a corner of the main road, you see that a group of enemies has been waiting for you. Could these be the protectors of this old city?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10244_DESCRIPTION":"You have reached the outer wall of the old city. It may be due to the materials it's made of, but it's still somehow untarnished and pearly white.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1024_DESCRIPTION":"Further into the ocean of trees you see some covered in exquisite flowers. Their petals rain down as the armored princess and gunner from another world approach.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10250_DESCRIPTION":"If you climb this set of strange-looking stairs, you will reach the old castle. However, climbing all these stairs is slightly depressing.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10251_DESCRIPTION":"The stairs keep going up, and up. You start to worry about Owen, but according to what Seria and Lugina said, you just have to trust he's fine.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10252_DESCRIPTION":"Even though there seems to be no end to this staircase, the enemies don't find it a problem to attack you. Be careful not to miss your step and fall.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10253_DESCRIPTION":"Due to the nature of this place, you can't avoid any fights. On top of that, enemies keep attacking you from high places, so you're in a tough spot.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10254_DESCRIPTION":"You can see the entrance to the castle. Once you clear the next wave of enemies, you should be able to go inside. That's where the real battle awaits.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10260_DESCRIPTION":"You destroy all the mechanisms you see before you as you move forth. It's possible that Karl is here, but what would he be doing in this place?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10261_DESCRIPTION":"As you look at the lights that flash on the floors and walls, you feel as if you had been swallowed by a giant machine. Perhaps that's what happened?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10262_DESCRIPTION":"You keep destroying all the equipment you lay your eyes upon, but nothing seems to happen. What is the purpose of all these gadgets anyway?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10263_DESCRIPTION":"Beiorg seems to be able to alter his stature and size, but there's no way he'd make the castle a part of his body...is there?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10264_DESCRIPTION":"By the way, where did Beiorg run off to? If this place is as important as Mora claims, then he should be here to protect it, and yet...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10265_DESCRIPTION":"As you wander around the silent castle, you hear a strange sound echo through its halls. It seems like Beiorg is on his way to you after all!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10270_DESCRIPTION":"Behind the castle and down the cliff lies a forest of dry trees. Will another demonic shadow show itself here? No more demons should be around, but...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102800_DESCRIPTION":"Entry to the Mysterious Paradise is only granted once a day. Croaking voices can be heard echoing in the distance.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_103001_DESCRIPTION":"The sword that once protected people during the war with the gods is now pointed in your direction. And with it, stern eyes that seem to test you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10300_DESCRIPTION":"Owen says one shouldn't have overly positive expectations. Let your guard down for a second, and you will be defeated. Better prepare yourself well.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10301_DESCRIPTION":"The city is burning. What could be the fuel of these flames, and when will they stop burning? Ishgria is truly a strange place.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10312_DESCRIPTION":"The atmosphere is terrible. It must be hard for the demons to live here, but impossible for humans to do the same. It weakens the spirit.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10313_DESCRIPTION":"A section of the lake seems to be boiling. However, it's not water springing forth, nor is the water really boiling. It's the effect of pollution.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10314_DESCRIPTION":"Could this lake and the burning city have been in their current state since the beginning? Or is there a reason behind their extreme conditions?",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_103300_DESCRIPTION":"A young magician who guided the people after receiving a divine revelation from the gods. Could the will of the gods have brought her back as well?",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10344_DESCRIPTION":"As you go deeper within the lair, you feel a cold chill about you. Could there be something at the bottom? You should go take a look.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1034_DESCRIPTION":"You reach the opposite end of the marsh. It doesn't seem like Grahdens is being held anywhere around here. Proceed to the sea.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10352_DESCRIPTION":"You've heard many legends that tell of beautiful crystals which can grant demonic powers. Could these be the same crystals of lore?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10353_DESCRIPTION":"The enemies here are stronger than those outside. Could it be the work of the crystals? Be careful not to get possessed by them.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10354_DESCRIPTION":"You know you're almost out of the cave when you feel a draft. The old castle where the demon Melord awaits shouldn't be too far now.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10361_DESCRIPTION":"The castle is in shambles. The passage of time, the influence of that rotting demon, and Owen's rage must have destroyed it. Time to find that demon.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10362_DESCRIPTION":"Grahdens mentioned that someone in Ishgria resents the Summoners of Old. However, the existence of such a creature is surprising in itself.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10364_DESCRIPTION":"The slime on the walls is still fresh. You hear something that sounds like Owen on a rampage. You have to keep moving forward.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10403_DESCRIPTION":"Apparently, what's flowing around is not lava, but molten metal. Is someone trying to build something with all this material?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10404_DESCRIPTION":"A wind that could burn your skin comes blasting in. This doesn't seem to be a part of the factory, but of a strong enemy waiting ahead.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10412_DESCRIPTION":"Is this glowing water safe to drink? You spot a Squirty playing in it and can't help but wonder if this is the source of its larger evolutions.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10413_DESCRIPTION":"Though this shiny water is strange, it is beautiful in its own way. If there were no danger lurking about, it would be the perfect place for a stroll.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10414_DESCRIPTION":"The smell of the coast wafts in, though there is no ocean in sight. It's safer to assume that a powerful enemy is behind it instead.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10544_DESCRIPTION":"It seems there's a passage that extends from the castle to the neighboring mountains, offering an exit. But it also appears to lead toward the giant.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1054_DESCRIPTION":"Something unusual stands before you amidst the rubble. Made of metal, it appears to be a summoned hero. Proceed slowly.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10550_DESCRIPTION":"You sensed something from Mora that wasn't there before; something like confusion. You feel like you understand Seria's concern a little better.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10551_DESCRIPTION":"You sense an almost-familiar presence. It could be that Shusui has caught up with you. Time to hurry.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10552_DESCRIPTION":"The great giant's remains seem to be holding their form without decaying or breaking down. Is this the power of Amu Yunos at work?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10553_DESCRIPTION":"Even while untouched by decay, the giant's corpse somehow makes you starkly aware of death. Are you over-thinking things?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10554_DESCRIPTION":"You have reached the giant's feet. You should be able to walk to Amu Yunos's tower from here. You must be prepared for anything.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1055_DESCRIPTION":"The smell of blood coming from near the gate opposite to the one you entered fills your nostrils. The tower is clos, but so is a very powerful enemy force.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10560_DESCRIPTION":"You never dreamed that a demon would call you chaotic. Maybe you should be more aware of the things you've done so far.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10561_DESCRIPTION":"You defeated the Four Fallen Gods and Lucius, and now demons fall before you wherever you go. Will you also take out Karna Masta in the future?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10562_DESCRIPTION":"Mora said that eight of them sealed Karna Masta, which means there are two other demons besides Amu Yunos.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10563_DESCRIPTION":"You need to defeat the demons to save Tilith. But if you do that, the seal on Karna Masta will break...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10564_DESCRIPTION":"Before you knew it, the top floor was but a few steps away. It's dangerous to fight while distracted. Make sure to keep yourself together.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10565_DESCRIPTION":"Amu Yunos is a demon you must face to save Tilith. That's all the reason you need to fight. Prepare for battle.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10566_DESCRIPTION":"For some reason, you have to face Owen now. If you refuse, Owen will probably flatten you anyway. So your only choice is to take him head on!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10570_DESCRIPTION":"When you step into the glistening crystal cave, it seems there is a demon deep within. Amu Yunos's Shadow likely awaits you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10571_DESCRIPTION":"You sense serenity in Mirfah's expression, unlike before. Sometimes, fighting just to see who's strongest feels good.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_105800_DESCRIPTION":"As you become lost in a strange forest, eerie silence surrounds you. The moment you hear a noise in the bushes, a girl jumps straight at you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_105801_DESCRIPTION":"The girl resembles a wildcat and her movements are incredibly fast. The minute she sees an opening, she may just trick you by sneaking in from behind.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_105802_DESCRIPTION":"She is half-human, half Sea Breeze Tribe. The reason why her pranks don't stop even in the heat of battle, is because she's found beloved friends.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_105900_DESCRIPTION":"As you come across a beautiful castle, an intimidating air overcomes you. Before you awaits the warrioress dubbed the \"Holy Knight of Glamour.\"",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_105901_DESCRIPTION":"The gallant and dazzling knight seems to grow even brighter with each battle. Her mere presence encourages her men, who also come after you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_105902_DESCRIPTION":"The knight smiles without a hint of hesitation. Proud of her soldiers, who gave their all in battle, she attacks one last time seeking victory.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10600_DESCRIPTION":"An individual with the head of a dragon suddenly attacks. He identifies himself as a follower of the land's demon ruler, and you must fight back.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10601_DESCRIPTION":"Disciple Liomerg addressed Karl respectfully. It seems that the demon in Karl's bloodline is the ruler of this land.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10602_DESCRIPTION":"The flames form first a firestorm, then spin into towering fire whirls. Who knows what happens if you get close to them. Be careful as you advance!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10603_DESCRIPTION":"It might be your imagination, but it seems like the enemies here are much more self-aware than any before, and that their attacks are more strategic.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10604_DESCRIPTION":"You're almost clear of the land of burning winds. Your clothes smell a bit charred. You've got to hurry ahead before they catch fire.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1060_DESCRIPTION":"You finally reach the tower atop the cape. Head for its top for your showdown against Zevalhua. Defeat the Fallen God so you can save Grahdens!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10610_DESCRIPTION":"Karl seems dead set on fighting no matter what. You're not done trying to talk him down yet, but you may need to face him in combat.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10611_DESCRIPTION":"You feel you need to defeat Karna Masta. If you don't, humanity will forever live in fear of the god's resurrection.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10612_DESCRIPTION":"You really want to believe in Karl. Despite this, you don't think the demon menace will go away even if Ishgria is unified.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10613_DESCRIPTION":"Even if Karna Masta weren't a threat, you would need to eliminate the demon threat in order to free Tilith.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10614_DESCRIPTION":"Regardless of whatever the demon Barion thought, you can't be sure without actually meeting it. Time to get moving.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1061_DESCRIPTION":"Sunlight pours into the tower, as if cheering you on. But you must have no time for such thoughts and must head upward toward your enemy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10620_DESCRIPTION":"A beautiful view of the continent extends before you. Compared to some other places, it's actually quite scenic.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10621_DESCRIPTION":"Circle around a cliff, climb a slope, look for a path, and climb back down, again and again. But you caught sight of something like a waterfall ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10622_DESCRIPTION":"On cresting a particularly high hill, you realized that the waterfall was actually a structure damming the river. You will need to get through it.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10623_DESCRIPTION":"Suddenly, you remember Mora's words. You can't imagine her becoming an ally, but if possible, you'd rather not have her as an enemy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10624_DESCRIPTION":"You can faintly hear what seems to be rushing water. That dam-like structure must be close. The enemies are fighting harder, as well.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1062_DESCRIPTION":"A hero from another world is waiting for you on this floor. Though it will not be an easy fight, it should be a fair one since you made it this far. ",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10630_DESCRIPTION":"There's nothing you can say to Paris in her distress. You just have to believe she'll find an answer for herself.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10631_DESCRIPTION":"Apparently, this massive dam also functions as a fortress. The interior is maze-like, and it won't be easy to get through.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10632_DESCRIPTION":"Formidable foes lie in wait at key points. As you fight an unpleasant thought crosses your mind, and you wonder if Karl sent them there.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10633_DESCRIPTION":"You have gotten lost in the fortress. You need to focus on moving ahead after all, without getting distracted by pointless questions.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10634_DESCRIPTION":"You arrived at the fortress's dam control room. According to the map found in the room, you should be able to get out from here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1063_DESCRIPTION":"As you climb up the stairs, you see a tremendous enemy blocking the sunlight. Make the heroes before you proud and trounce this ten-winged tormentor!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10640_DESCRIPTION":"It seems that Karl wasn't able to fully awaken the demonic power within himself. Perhaps he still has some doubts...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10641_DESCRIPTION":"If Karl is still uncertain, you know what you need to do. Eliminate the threats of the demons and Karna Masta, and save Tilith.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10642_DESCRIPTION":"You leave the plaza and find yourself on the main street. Across the bridge ahead is the gate to the outskirts of town. Liomerg is probably there.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10643_DESCRIPTION":"Apparently, formidable foes await you on the bridge. You want to conserve your strength before fighting Liomerg, but that may be impossible.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10644_DESCRIPTION":"Liomerg stands before the gate. You don't see Karl, but he's probably watching. You can't embarrass yourself now.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1064_DESCRIPTION":"You have never felt air this thick with tension and signs of enemies nearby. Prepare yourself, for the next battle may be your last.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106500_DESCRIPTION":"An Elgaian martial artist who served during the foundation of Akras Summoners' Hall. Even in death, his soul seeks worthy opponents to battle.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106501_DESCRIPTION":"The martial artist only ever truly felt alive during a battle. He still longs to feel the thrill of a duel with another demon.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10650_DESCRIPTION":"This isn't your first fight with Lugina. But he says he'll show you a new power he had kept hidden, so this won't go like the last time.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10651_DESCRIPTION":"You're advancing across a gigantic spider's web. The thick threads are stable, but watch your step. Especially since you're up against Lugina.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10652_DESCRIPTION":"Lose your footing and you'll fall into the depths. It seems like there's water down there, but this is Ishgria. You won't come out unscathed.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10653_DESCRIPTION":"Lugina's fighting spirit... That feeling you get when you face a formidable foe... You need to get serious, before Lugina summons his true strength.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10654_DESCRIPTION":"You see Lugina laughing as though he's invincible. He has the advantage no matter where you approach from. Be careful, and give it your all!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1065_DESCRIPTION":"Everybody knows of the hero from Agni clad in flames. His reputation precedes him, like the sinister air that fills the passageway in front of you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106600_DESCRIPTION":"Long ago, the Elgaia Federation formed a secret Ishgria Expeditionary Force with convicts. What sort of officer could lead this unlikely team?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106601_DESCRIPTION":"Betrayed by the Federation and abandoned in a demon-ravaged land, the souls of the Ishgria Expeditionary Force wander even now...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10660_DESCRIPTION":"As expected, it's difficult to talk with demons. But they might be more cooperative if you demonstrate your power?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10661_DESCRIPTION":"You head for the summit, defeating one enemy after another. You start to wonder if demons are only capable of understanding others through combat.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10662_DESCRIPTION":"You approach the midpoint of the mountain trail. Ahead, at the peak, you can sense a presence so powerful it stifles your spirit. Is it a dragon?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10663_DESCRIPTION":"A gate capable of moving Karna Masta, seal and all... But you're worried that a power on that level just might break the seal.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10664_DESCRIPTION":"You see Liomerg on the final incline before the peak. This is probably the end of the line. Get ready for a decisive battle!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10665_DESCRIPTION":"Only the demon Barion remains. If you can't win here, it would be foolish to face Karna Masta. It's time to show your power!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1066_DESCRIPTION":"You have made it to the top of the tower after defeating the burning hero. But now you must do what the gods couldn't and defeat the Fallen God Zevalhua!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106700_DESCRIPTION":"A brilliant Federation researcher obsessed with otherworldly technology. Could it be the master's own mad spirit that inhabits his precious automaton?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106701_DESCRIPTION":"It's said that his beloved automaton was further augmented to battle against demons. Its crazed spirit still seeks new targets to destroy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10670_DESCRIPTION":"You have to face the demon Kalon's Shadow alongside Lugina. The true seal on Karna Masta should break soon as well. The time to fight draws near.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10671_DESCRIPTION":"It's been a long time since you fought with Paris. She wants to fight to overcome her doubts. With that in mind, you want to give your all.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106800_DESCRIPTION":"A tribe of tenacious hunters once lived on Elgaia's frontier. When tragedy struck, only one lived on to avenge their catastrophic downfall.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106801_DESCRIPTION":"After taking revenge, the lone hunter wanted no more than to return to his people's traditions of living and dying by the hunt of powerful fiends.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106900_DESCRIPTION":"This Elgaian priestess was a devout believer of the Sealed God Lucius. In her mind, justice was found only in the teachings of her infallible god.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_106901_DESCRIPTION":"Betrayed, only one purpose remained to her: \"Destroy the enemies of our god.\" Even in death, could her spirit ever find peace?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107000_DESCRIPTION":"A spy from the Randall Empire had infiltrated the Elgaia Federation. He fought alone to discover the truth behind the Ishgria Expedition.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107001_DESCRIPTION":"With no way to return home, he continued his investigation. Even now, his soul seeks a path home, to give his final report.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10700_DESCRIPTION":"Mora states her goal is to unify the world and end all conflict. But she is a demon, too. For that reason alone she won't avoid friction.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10701_DESCRIPTION":"Mora didn't come out and say it, but she wants help. Even so, everyone is resolved. They can't accede to her ambitions.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10702_DESCRIPTION":"It seems this facility pumps up oil from beneath the sea floor. A lot of devices made with otherworldly technologies use this oil.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10703_DESCRIPTION":"Some of the oil that is pumped up is burned to remove impurities. That is why this facility belches forth flames endlessly.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10704_DESCRIPTION":"Clouds of black, poisonous smoke stand in your way. You want to hurry ahead to the snowy plains after Mora, but the enemies in your way come first.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107100_DESCRIPTION":"You've crossed the Vortex gate and find yourself in a luxurious room. You proceed with caution, though you seem to always end up in the same place...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107101_DESCRIPTION":"You keep wandering inside the lavish palace. Its internal structure seems improbable, and you begin noticing that you can't really move forth.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107102_DESCRIPTION":"Walking around the extravagant palace, you come across a terrible presence in its depths. Chills run through you as a giant door stands before you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10710_DESCRIPTION":"Your allies seem alright. Rescue can wait; focus on fighting Mora. Your fate was to face her. Hopefully this will be the last time for it, though.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10711_DESCRIPTION":"You must assemble demonic powers to face Karna Masta. That means that if Mora wasn't lying, you'll need her help.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10712_DESCRIPTION":"A raging wind chills you to the bone, and drowns out the sound of your footsteps. All you can see is white, and you still have a long way to go.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10713_DESCRIPTION":"You can barely keep to the path due to the blizzard. But you won't lose sight of your goal. Advance without wavering, so you can rescue Tilith.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10714_DESCRIPTION":"All you can do is focus on advancing as you push through deep snowdrifts. Suddenly a fierce wind springs up, and the blizzard intensifies.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107200_DESCRIPTION":"You take in the strange scenery before you. Overwhelmed by the divine atmosphere of the place, you watch as a so-called angel begins his descent.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107201_DESCRIPTION":"While enjoying the magnificent atmosphere of the place, you see countless angels floating above you. Their beautiful formation moves you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107202_DESCRIPTION":"The otherworldly beings in the room are immersed in keeping their order, which makes you want to do the same. Make sure not to lose yourself as well.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10720_DESCRIPTION":"You were finally released from the blizzard's abuse thanks to your arrival in the frozen woods. But the cold is unchanged, and your hands are numb.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10721_DESCRIPTION":"It feels as though time itself has frozen in the silence of these woods. You let out a deep sigh, and continue to advance steadily.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10722_DESCRIPTION":"Snow falls through the gaps between trees. Sometimes, a clump falls from the branches noisily, startling you by sounding like an enemy's approach.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10723_DESCRIPTION":"The white snow and dark trees deceive your eyes. Deep snowdrifts entangle your legs. Protracted fighting here is harder than you imagined.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10724_DESCRIPTION":"The trees have thinned out. You are almost out of the woods, and you miss warmer lands. Hopefully somewhere more sheltered is coming up next.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107300_DESCRIPTION":"You stand before a temple of curious design. Not only is its appearance overbearing, but it also exudes an intense air of benevolence.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107301_DESCRIPTION":"Inside the temple, a multitude of candles flicker in the darkness. You proceed with extreme caution atop the red carpet sprawled on the floor.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107302_DESCRIPTION":"You hear haunting voices chanting from afar. Their amalgamation strikes a cord deep within you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10730_DESCRIPTION":"There is a gate of appropriate size for the immense valley it blocks off built across the precipice. It seems to be mechanical.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10731_DESCRIPTION":"A single path extends toward the mechanical gate. It seems you will have to fight Shusui here after all. Prepare yourself.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10732_DESCRIPTION":"There's something weird and mechanical on the path. Could it be a device for transferring power generated at the oil well?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10733_DESCRIPTION":"While it's better than the plains or the woods, it's still cold here. It's so cold that you're almost eager to fight with Shusui already.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10734_DESCRIPTION":"Is Shusui covered in wounds from his battle with Owen? Or was it one of Mora's traps? Either way, you can't hold back against him.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10740_DESCRIPTION":"You are finally free of the cold. Truthfully, it's cold here too, but still so much warmer than you have been for a while. You feel alive again.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10741_DESCRIPTION":"You're inside a cave, but its walls of transparent ice let the outside light shine in. It reflects off every surface, eliminating all shadows.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10742_DESCRIPTION":"Sound reverberates in the cave just as light reflects. Your footsteps echo many times over, and it sounds almost like you're leading a small army.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10743_DESCRIPTION":"You emerged into a spacious cavern. The refracted light is concentrated here, and some of the ice is melted. It's also a bit warm, thankfully.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10744_DESCRIPTION":"Your eyes are growing tired, possibly because of the shining cave. They're also dry, and your vision is blurry. Getting attacked now would be risky.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107500_DESCRIPTION":"A Quest designed by Mr. Just Nojima, head of Famitsu App's Brave Frontier. Knowing his usual gimmicks is the key to clearing this dungeon!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107501_DESCRIPTION":"A challenging Quest designed by Mr. Misasagi, a legitimate Brave Frontier player. Could an experienced player make for a good developer as well?!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107502_DESCRIPTION":"A mystical hidden Quest to celebrate our 3rd Anniversary. It is rumored that only the bravest of Summoners are able to clear it...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10750_DESCRIPTION":"Lugina said Karl's kindness was weakness. So what is strength? In all its grandeur, nature gives no answer.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10751_DESCRIPTION":"A vicious, howling wind rolls over the side of the cliffs. Your body is stripped of all the warmth it accumulated within the cave in an instant.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10752_DESCRIPTION":"You climb the path that juts out from the ice wall. At each crossroads you come across you must choose the safest-looking one from many options.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10753_DESCRIPTION":"You should arrive at the castle where Mora awaits once you make it up this cliff. Looking up or down is terrifying, but you just have to keep going.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10754_DESCRIPTION":"You've gotten close to the top. If you lose your footing here you're finished, yet your enemies fight without concern for the location. Be careful.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107600_DESCRIPTION":"You can see the great Royal Capital before you after crossing the gate. As you approach it with care, a huge arena catches your eye.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107601_DESCRIPTION":"A blonde young man awaits in the otherworldly arena of the Royal Capital smiling fearlessly as he unsheathes his blade. Challenges seem to please him.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107602_DESCRIPTION":"The many marks around the arena suggest men and beasts have fought here before. How many battles to the death has this place seen on a regular basis?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10760_DESCRIPTION":"You proceed down the path that Lugina and Seria cleared as they went ahead. But then enemies appeared, as though they were waiting. It's an ambush.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10761_DESCRIPTION":"This former stronghold of a demon leader is as elegant and impressive as you would expect. Even long years later, that hasn't changed.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10762_DESCRIPTION":"It's said that the demons fell into an era of chaotic war after their leader left. It would appear this castle's purpose was lost afterwards, as well.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10763_DESCRIPTION":"The two Summoners of Old are here, as are Bertz and Liomerg. The key will probably be whoever finds Mora first.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10764_DESCRIPTION":"Apparently, this castle's original master had un-demonly dreams of eliminating conflict. Mora said she was taking up that quest, but...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107650_DESCRIPTION":"You see a great arena before you past the gate to another world. A young man with flowing long black hair awaits with sword in hand.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107651_DESCRIPTION":"Amidst all the commotion in this new world, you meet a young man with black hair that excels in swordsmanship. There is nowhere to run now.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107652_DESCRIPTION":"The deep claw marks and gashes left upon the structure of the arena are a testament of the vicious battles that continuously take place here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10765_DESCRIPTION":"Alongside Seria, you challenge Mora. Having absorbed the other demons, Mora is much stronger than ever before. Don't hold back!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10766_DESCRIPTION":"Postpone your happiness for reuniting with Tilith and defeat Mora! Now is your chance, while her power is out of control!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107700_DESCRIPTION":"Swallowed by the vortex, the Summoner lands in a wasteland world. A Suddenly, a swarm of outlaws begin surrounding the area... ",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107701_DESCRIPTION":"One man stands among the swarm exuding an air of wildness, and roaring loudly. \"The 300,000 World Dollars on your head...they're mine.\" ",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107702_DESCRIPTION":"\"Tsch, looks like I've been played\" he said, as if he'd been fooled by someone. \"Don't worry, I'll pay every hit of yours back with some of my own.\"",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10770_DESCRIPTION":"Face Seria's feelings, and give this battle your all. It will help your friend find her own path.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10771_DESCRIPTION":"Barion shows his true power and form. Face him alongside Karl, whose demonic powers have awakened! The answer Karl seeks must lie ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107800_DESCRIPTION":"Beyond the Vortex lay a luxurious court. Knights rush forward to kill the Summoner, as the punishment is death for those who dare attempt regicide. ",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107801_DESCRIPTION":"The young king appears with a sword covered in lightning. He says \"It is the sword that asks what lies within a warrior's breast,\" and a fight erupts.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107802_DESCRIPTION":"There are things that can only be told through a duel to the death. One's position, one's feelings. And thus, their swords clashed in \"danger time.\"",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107900_DESCRIPTION":"A celebration full of heroes from all over the world that's just begun! As they talk amongst themselves, could they be sending us a message too...?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_107901_DESCRIPTION":"A celebration full of heroes from all over the world that's just begun! As they talk amongst themselves, could they be sending us a message too...?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10800_DESCRIPTION":"It seems Kalon knows who lies ahead. But no matter what foe awaits, you must defeat the Holy Emperor with Tilith.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10801_DESCRIPTION":"The blazing gate opens, scorching the very air. Under cover of billowing smoke, countless enemies have poured forth. Don't let them slow you down.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10802_DESCRIPTION":"Hellish flames roar all around. You must conserve your strength as you dispatch the approaching foes. The path looks longer than anticipated.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10803_DESCRIPTION":"As you clear the gate, the heat fades, but the onslaught intensifies. Behind you, enemy reinforcements leap down from above the gate.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10804_DESCRIPTION":"Enemy resistance has subsided. One last group blocks your way. Dispatch them, and you can finally escape the influence of the Eight Sealed Gods' Gate.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10810_DESCRIPTION":"Boiling water gushes from deep within the earth, and falls on you like scalding rain. But you must focus on the enemies at hand.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10811_DESCRIPTION":"As Lugina suggests, the lack of resistance so far is perplexing. You should seize the chance to press forward.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1261_DESCRIPTION":"You cannot find the staircase that leads upstairs, so you take the only way available deep inside. The path seems slanted, slowly curving upwards.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1262_DESCRIPTION":"The curved hallway spirals upwards and upwards. If you stumble when you lose in battle, you may end up tumbling all the way down...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1263_DESCRIPTION":"You reach the top to find a large room. As if the same type of powerful enemy had been waiting for you all along, you're suddenly attacked.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1264_DESCRIPTION":"You go upstairs, open the doors, and find another large room. After just one step, the doors close and a strong enemy is summoned. Just a bit more.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1265_DESCRIPTION":"After a fierce battle, you climb your way up through some narrow stairs. On your way to the top an enemy shows itself, but there's no going back now!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1266_DESCRIPTION":"Finally at the top, there's no doubt that Zurg is waiting. If you defeat the disciple of the last Fallen God, Afla Dilith will be the only enemy left!",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1311_DESCRIPTION":"The sun shines through an ice wall and though no light is lit within the temple, it's bright inside. The light suddenly refracts, creating a rainbow.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1320_DESCRIPTION":"An ancient forest that few have visited before. There seem to be no natural paths. You'll have to use your sense of direction to get out of this one.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1322_DESCRIPTION":"Along with a shrilling cry, a flock of birds flies off frightened. A loud roar follows after. It's the sound of an otherworldly machine at work!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1323_DESCRIPTION":"You get the feeling that something is inviting you deep into the sea of trees. You can't help thinking you're being led to a den full of enemies.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1324_DESCRIPTION":"The space between the trees has widened. The end of the forest may be near. This can only mean that enemies more powerful than before await you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1330_DESCRIPTION":"The fate of the future... What Paris told you is starting to make sense. However, you must first focus on defeating the last Fallen God.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1331_DESCRIPTION":"The large drops of rain won't stop, striking you as they fall. Your body gets colder, and as you sneeze, the sound of thunder resonates around you.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1334_DESCRIPTION":"The continuous roaring of the thunder has made your ears feel funny. You wouldn't survive an ambush in this state, so you best be cautious.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1340_DESCRIPTION":"It's still a long way to Afla Dilith, but everyone keeps talking about what will come after that. Let's not worry about those things for now.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1341_DESCRIPTION":"The herd of Pegasus was just frightened, but something more alarming soars the skies. War goddesses spread their wings to prepare for battle.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1342_DESCRIPTION":"This road offers a clear view of the surroundings, so there's no fear of an ambush. However, there's nothing you can use to deflect aerial attacks.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1343_DESCRIPTION":"How long have you advanced? Now you can really see the castle Afla Dilith has assimilated with. Is that what you will face in the future?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1344_DESCRIPTION":"A road for pilgrims. Long ago, pilgrims passed through here to pray to the gods. Ironically, you're taking this road in order to defeat a god.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1345_DESCRIPTION":"The end of the road is near. A strong power can be felt coming from it. The enemy lurking there will most likely be your last obstacle here.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1351_DESCRIPTION":"There are still many enemies left on the way to the castle. Surely Karl and the others will have to face even more of them as you move on ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1352_DESCRIPTION":"The sound of your allies fighting behind you grows louder. Head towards the castle while everyone else draws the enemies' attention.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1353_DESCRIPTION":"The enemies in your path continue getting stronger. It can only mean that your last target is drawing near. The castle's gates should be just ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1354_DESCRIPTION":"The castle is within a stone's throw, and the god's powerful presence grows stronger. However, it's no time to buckle under pressure. Step inside.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1355_DESCRIPTION":"You can see the last hoard of enemies in front of the gate. If you can get past them, you will finally be inside Afla Dilith!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1360_DESCRIPTION":"Tilith, Karl, everyone... You're worried about the friends you left behind fighting. However, there's no turning back now. You must press forward.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1361_DESCRIPTION":"Looking inside the castle, nothing really seems out of place. Although without Tilith's protective barrier, you might have fallen prey to Afla Dilith.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1362_DESCRIPTION":"You can hear Tilith fighting from the entrance. Inspired by her courage, your feet rush forward at full speed!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1363_DESCRIPTION":"As you proceed further in, the sounds of battle coming from the entrance disappear. You can still feel Tilith's barrier protecting you, though.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1364_DESCRIPTION":"You've made your way through a big portion of the fortress. Past this corridor lies its center. The real body of the Fallen God is probably there.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1365_DESCRIPTION":"You exit into a room enveloped in tree roots. The next step should lead you to the heart of the castle, but a dark hero blocks your path.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1366_DESCRIPTION":"The time for the real final fight with the last Fallen God, the Beast God Afla Dilith, has come... Defeat him and return to your friends!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1370_DESCRIPTION":"After visiting the temple a second time, you think you hear the voice of a young girl singing. Her song made the rough waves vanish like the sea foam.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1400_DESCRIPTION":"A hair raising howling can be heard. It looks like many monsters seem to inhabit this town, so there seems to be no easy escape from here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1401_DESCRIPTION":"A beautiful singing voice lingers in the air. Could this be the work of a demon as well? And why have so many monsters gathered in this ghost town?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1402_DESCRIPTION":"How strange. No matter how much you advance, you keep finding yourself back where you started. It's like being in the fairies' grove all over again.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1403_DESCRIPTION":"There are too many enemies. What could've led them here? As you think that to yourself, a piercing and thunderous sound resonates around you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1404_DESCRIPTION":"The neigh of a Pegasus reaches your ears, a pure sound ill-fitted for this ghost town. A battle with the maidens awaits ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1405_DESCRIPTION":"You can feel many more enemies obstructing your way now. If you're lucky enough, defeating the last hoard of them might be your ticket out of here. ",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1410_DESCRIPTION":"You can see a vast desert in front of you. There seems to be no end to it, but you must take this cruel path in order to move forward.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1411_DESCRIPTION":"You confirm the sun's location to avoid losing your way. Short on patience and with your body almost boiling, beads of sweat fall from your forehead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1412_DESCRIPTION":"A cloud of sand starts covering your clothes. You swallow the fine pieces of sand the wind picks up as you breathe. Deserts are still not your forte.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1413_DESCRIPTION":"As the sunshine gets hotter, heat haze begins to rise from beneath. Beyond the shaky mirage in front of you, you spy the creeping shadow of the enemy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1414_DESCRIPTION":"A cloudless, blue firmament above, and scorching, yellow sand beneath. As you look behind you, everything grows darker. A sandstorm is on its way.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1420_DESCRIPTION":"After leaving the great the desert behind, you come across a river so big that the shore seems invisible. It will take a lot of effort to cross it.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1421_DESCRIPTION":"At times, the river fish jump high up. Surprised by the sound, you finally see the enemy closing in. You realize now the fish were trying to warn you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1422_DESCRIPTION":"Halfway up the river you hear a creaking noise and see that the surface of the river has begun to freeze. It seems the enemy is here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1423_DESCRIPTION":"As you admire the grandeur of this river, you reminisce of battle. Even though you have defeated the Four Fallen Gods, other battles still lie ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1424_DESCRIPTION":"A strong wind blows. The water's surface ripples, and then crashes in a big splash. It may be a sign of the road up ahead, which makes you nervous.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1430_DESCRIPTION":"As you walk through the thick forest, you get lost. The path to a free future... You'll have to make your own way to get there.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1431_DESCRIPTION":"You arrive at a place in the forest where a small spring bubbles. You consider taking a rest, but enemies start appearing one by one. Break's over.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1432_DESCRIPTION":"A strong wind blows in the forest. As the leaves brush upon each other they sound like the waves of the ocean. It's a sea of trees indeed.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1433_DESCRIPTION":"Breeze blows strongly through the trees, picking up old leaves, and fluttering new ones. This is the force that transforms the forest anew.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1434_DESCRIPTION":"The sea of trees sways as the wind hits it. One could say that even these living beings feel anxious about the future fate of the world.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1440_DESCRIPTION":"The rough, shiny rock around shows traces of lightning. It seems it has been absorbing it during the endless storms. Pressing forward won't be easy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1441_DESCRIPTION":"As you climb an electrified cliff, you pass peaks as sharp as needles. You can't help but feel like this road is a premonition of the future to come.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1442_DESCRIPTION":"The thunder and lightning that falls here is absorbed by the mountain. It has accumulated so much after the years that it might burst any minute now.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1443_DESCRIPTION":"You've reached the Mt. Granakia's highest peak, where you can see the whole of Atharva. You see a giant castle in the distance. Is that Eriole's base?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1444_DESCRIPTION":"You can see Paris at the bottom of the cliff. It seems she followed you here. You were told to talk to her, but what exactly do you have in mind?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1450_DESCRIPTION":"After climbing over the mountain, you reach a beautiful garden. However, no people seem to come here, so how has it been kept so well maintained?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1451_DESCRIPTION":"Beautiful flower beds are arranged next to each other in the garden. These amazing flowers couldn't have bloomed without lots of care, and yet...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1452_DESCRIPTION":"You can see a fountain amidst the flower beds. The water sparkles as it flows from a beautifully carved pedestal. What a great spectacle to behold.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1453_DESCRIPTION":"Small birds flutter about, chirping a song. One flees suddenly, and when you follow it with your eyes, you see a great shadow dropping from the sky...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1454_DESCRIPTION":"The floral aroma, the chirping of the birds, and the beauty of the trimmed hedges... Looking at it now, this is a beautiful, if not perfect, garden.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1455_DESCRIPTION":"Could this garden have been made by human hands? How could it have remained so beautiful without any people left to care for it?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1456_DESCRIPTION":"Small flowers sway in the wind, butterflies flutter about, and the birds fly high in the sky. A wind of new beginnings is leaving the old age behind.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1460_DESCRIPTION":"Having passed the gorgeous garden, you reach a gloomy cemetery. Among the expressionless tombstones standing, a voice calls from within the silence.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1461_DESCRIPTION":"Tesla said Paris was useless to them now. If Eriole truly feels that way, then just what could he be after...?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1462_DESCRIPTION":"This part of the cemetery seems to be dedicated to soldiers fallen in battle. You can see that their tombstones have a sword symbol carved onto them.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1463_DESCRIPTION":"If a civil war breaks in Elgaia, many lives will be lost. This must be prevented at all costs.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1464_DESCRIPTION":"Reading the few words you can make out from the headstones, you gather that this was once one of the most important places in Atharva.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1465_DESCRIPTION":"You feel something cold run down your spine. Feeling an evil presence, you look around you. Darkness is closing in, the enemy's coming!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1466_DESCRIPTION":"Not even the wind seems to reach this place, and your movements start to feel sluggish. The smell of moss and mold lingers in the air.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1470_DESCRIPTION":"The spark of battle has been ignited. Defeat the enemies standing in your way, and head towards the depths of Eriole's castle!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1471_DESCRIPTION":"A cold steel blade strikes at you, and fiery claws rush towards you. No matter who the enemy may be, you must not falter!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1472_DESCRIPTION":"A fist cracks the floor open, and a lance tries to pierce you as you counterattack. Strong enemies have gathered here, but you must press on!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1473_DESCRIPTION":"Lightning flashes in the hall, and a sword that seems to block darkness shimmers brightly. If you want to stop the revolution, focus on the enemy now!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1474_DESCRIPTION":"Light pierces the walls, and countless arrows begin to rain down. The enemy is strong, but you still have morale. Hurry and make your way through!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1475_DESCRIPTION":"Dual blades dance in the air, and one strike from a hefty lance breaks the floor open. Just a bit more till you face Eriole deep in the castle.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1476_DESCRIPTION":"The shadow overhead is just as strong as the light. The world is being distorted, probably tearing at the seams. You're just steps away from Eriole!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1477_DESCRIPTION":"Eriole's ideas are warped. The idea that a bloody revolution can bring about a peaceful future cannot possibly be true. He must be stopped.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1480_DESCRIPTION":"You discover a cave dispersing an ominous miasma. There are traces of a strong seal at the entrance, but you seem to be able to come and go freely.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20014_DESCRIPTION":"Just as you\u2019re about to exit on the other side of Ignia Falls, a watery monarch emerges from behind the waterfall. He\u2019s come to expel the intruders in his domain...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20020_DESCRIPTION":"On the other side of the huge waterfall a vast forest stretches as far as the eye can see. According to Lugina, the monsters here are the most dangerous you\u2019ve faced.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20021_DESCRIPTION":"The overgrown foliage deep inside the forest is maze-like in its complexity. What lies on the other side?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20022_DESCRIPTION":"Even after the world has been reduced to rubble, the souls of bandits continue to exist deep within the forest. They target travelers\u2019 valuables, just like when they were alive.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20023_DESCRIPTION":"The bandits tell of a dragon who protects all the trees in the forest. Could that be where this distant roar is coming from?",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20040_DESCRIPTION":"You arrive at the Tower of Light hot on the heels of Lugina and Paris. Could the mystery of Cordelica really lie within its radiant and lofty walls?",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20042_DESCRIPTION":"The higher you climb, the tougher the monsters seem to get. Amid all the chaos, the sound of a beautiful and bewitching singing voice beckons you ever higher.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20043_DESCRIPTION":"Nothing poses a greater threat to Summoners than monsters of opposite elements cooperating to launch a combination attack. Fire and water, for instance...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20044_DESCRIPTION":"Countless monsters appear as if to drive the intruders from their hallowed tower. But what are they protecting? Part of Cordelica's past, or some other hidden truth?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20045_DESCRIPTION":"As the fight continues to escalate, the sound of gunfire mixed in with the roar of monsters hints at even more danger to come. Could Lugina have found something?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20046_DESCRIPTION":"An overwhelming presence emanates from the top of the tower. Could it be the legendary power bestowed upon those who\u2019ve heard the voice of the gods?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20050_DESCRIPTION":"A mine shaft winds its way in the direction of the Giant's Ruins. Monsters fond of the dank conditions lurk in the shadows, their fangs occasionally glinting in the darkness.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20051_DESCRIPTION":"Spots of nature continue to exist even in this most man-made of environments. Unfortunately, nature isn\u2019t always man\u2019s ally...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20052_DESCRIPTION":"The dark mineshaft continues to beckon weary travelers deeper inside its murky maw. Monsters can smell fear, so whatever you do, beware your sweet scent.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20053_DESCRIPTION":"You emerge from what you thought was a never-ending tunnel to be greeted by a bright light, only to find out the light was actually a flash of lightning.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20054_DESCRIPTION":"An evil air pervades the pitch-blackness of the mine\u2019s innermost reaches. Exhausted by their travails, despair nibbles at the heart of any weary traveler on this road.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20055_DESCRIPTION":"A glimmer of hope crosses your mind as you feel the route slowly ascending, though the air of death continues to loom about in the shadows around you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20056_DESCRIPTION":"A faint light glimmers at the end of what seemed like never-ending darkness. Standing before it, a nightmarish monster rears its head, revealing a bewitching smile.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20060_DESCRIPTION":"You come to some vast and ancient ruins, cloaked in an air of solemnity. The time of Cordelica\u2019s reckoning is soon at hand. Prepare yourself for the battle ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20061_DESCRIPTION":"You follow Lugina\u2019s orders and launch yourself into the path of the marauding monsters. You have to give it all you've got on the front lines!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20062_DESCRIPTION":"As if drawn by the heat of battle, monsters from far and wide descend upon your position. You can\u2019t afford to rest until Lugina has defeated Grantos!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20063_DESCRIPTION":"Locked in the throes of battle, a strange sensation overcomes you momentarily. You don\u2019t know what caused it, but you decide to track its source...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20064_DESCRIPTION":"The carvings here are even more ornate than those near the entrance of the ruins. A fresh gash runs horizontally across one of the giant frescoes. What could've done this?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20065_DESCRIPTION":"Continuing deeper into the ruins in search of the strange sensation\u2019s source, you come across souls driven mad mad by anger. What could have done this?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20066_DESCRIPTION":"The source of the strange sensation is revealed in a legendary giants with powers rivaling those of the gods. Do you run, or stay and fight?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20067_DESCRIPTION":"After defeating the giants, you now face the toughest challenge of all in their king, Grantos. The final showdown to determine the fate of Cordelica is about to begin.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20070_DESCRIPTION":"There's a cavern just behind the Ignia Falls. A mysterious beast has awaken deep inside, seemingly disturbed by your battle with the giants. What could it be?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_200_DESCRIPTION":"Your journey through Morgan begins in a huge desert. The scorching haze indicates the fierce battle to come.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20100_DESCRIPTION":"Now you can't rely on anything else but your own physical power. And although Tilith may be helping, you should stay alert.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20101_DESCRIPTION":"Even surrounded by enemies, at least you were able to meet with Lugina's subordinate, Reda. Watch how she fights.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20102_DESCRIPTION":"This is what it is to fight for yourself, feeling the resistance through your weapons. You can see how much you've depended on Summoning until now.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_201_DESCRIPTION":"The bandits in this burning desert have much stronger resolve that those in Mistral, and it seems they intend to block your way.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20200_DESCRIPTION":"A bizarre scene of machines making machines unfolds before you. They make machines in Elgaia, too, but there is no comparison in scale.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20201_DESCRIPTION":"Machines are everywhere you look. There's no sign of any people. Could this be related to the collapse Reda spoke of?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20202_DESCRIPTION":"You've gotten used to fighting without Summoning. Even so, it might not go well if you run into a powerful enemy as you are now.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_202_DESCRIPTION":"A summoned being known as the king of beasts is rampaging in the desert. A fierce battle with him is unavoidable.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20300_DESCRIPTION":"You've won the trust of a strange automaton. Your goal keeps moving further away. You've got to fight through swarming enemies to get there.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20301_DESCRIPTION":"The land around you is covered in broken machines, and the sharp debris makes for bad footing. You have to hurry or you'll lose sight of your goal.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20302_DESCRIPTION":"Your target has slowed down. You're almost there. You've grown confident in your fighting skills, so now it's time to close the gap.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20303_DESCRIPTION":"Your target has stopped moving. However, you sense a powerful feeling of malice close by. You won't be able to avoid a difficult fight.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_203_DESCRIPTION":"You've reached the desert's mid point. An incarnation of flames blocks the way, further scorching the land around it.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20400_DESCRIPTION":"Hatch and Tull, you've picked up some unexpected companions on your journey. More importantly, these automatons seem oddly human.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20401_DESCRIPTION":"You proceed into the tower made of geometric crystal and metal. It looks like it was built for people to live in, but there's no sign of anyone.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20402_DESCRIPTION":"According to Hatch and Tull, humans vanished from this world long ago. Yet the city seems to be perfectly preserved...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20403_DESCRIPTION":"There are some mechanical experts and actual machines among those you can Summon, but are any of them connected to this world?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20404_DESCRIPTION":"Leaving Mersas, you're finally almost at the Information Tower. It would be nice if you could get there without trouble, but...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_204_DESCRIPTION":"The end of the desert is in view, and the wind now smells of the sea. However, a giant silhouette stands blocks your path...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20500_DESCRIPTION":"You made it to the Information Tower, your present goal. You're able to use Summoning again for whatever reason, so you might as well start climbing.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20501_DESCRIPTION":"You've gotten used to fighting for yourself alongside Summoning. You feel like you've grown to understand why Karl and Seria fight this way.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20502_DESCRIPTION":"There's probably a device you can get information from on the top floor, but before that a powerful enemy you must fight awaits.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20600_DESCRIPTION":"You probably shouldn't be surprised, but it seems Bertz made it to this world first. Reda doesn't even need to tell you that you have to hurry.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20601_DESCRIPTION":"This wasteland is wildly different from the rest of Bectas. Is this an area they've extracted ores from in order to make machines?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20602_DESCRIPTION":"You can see a building past the wasteland. That's probably your destination. What is the being that protects this world? Does this world have gods?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20603_DESCRIPTION":"You feel something unpleasant, but it's not malice. Is it a premonition? Watch for dangerous enemies near the building as you advance.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20700_DESCRIPTION":"As expected, the building was full of machines. It also seems to be full of enemies. Be careful, you don't know what else awaits you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20701_DESCRIPTION":"Massive numbers of machines are attacking. It's exhausting and there's no end in sight. Reda appears to be sick of it, too.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20702_DESCRIPTION":"Hatch and Tull seem to have told the truth about lacking combat abilities. Maybe this would have been easier if they could fight with you...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20703_DESCRIPTION":"You hear an unnatural sound that you recognize. It seems a formidable foe you've fought many times awaits you. Take up your weapon and move forward.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20704_DESCRIPTION":"You've arrived at the central block. Find the being that protects Bectas, and your mission is complete. Yet you feel like you're forgetting something.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20705_DESCRIPTION":"Lugina breaks through a wall and appears. You don't have time to ask questions. For now, defeat the massive automaton he called the \"Divine Machine\"!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20800_DESCRIPTION":"You've arrived at the building Reda discovered and was set on exploring. This place is clearly different from the other buildings on Bectas.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20_DESCRIPTION":"The magma flowing within this cave gives off an intense heat. The enemies in this cave have the power of fire.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2100000_DESCRIPTION":"These mock Units are made of something completely different. You're in for a shock once you start fighting them!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2100001_DESCRIPTION":"These mock Units are made of something completely different. You're in for a shock once you start fighting them!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2100002_DESCRIPTION":"These mock Units are made of something completely different. You're in for a shock once you start fighting them!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2100003_DESCRIPTION":"These mock Units are made of something completely different. You're in for a shock once you start fighting them!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2100004_DESCRIPTION":"These mock Units are made of something completely different. You're in for a shock once you start fighting them!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2100005_DESCRIPTION":"These mock Units are made of something completely different. You're in for a shock once you start fighting them!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2100006_DESCRIPTION":"These mock Units are made of something completely different. You're in for a shock once you start fighting them!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2100007_DESCRIPTION":"These mock Units are made of something completely different. You're in for a shock once you start fighting them!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21000_DESCRIPTION":"The old castle ringed with a half-frozen lake like a moat makes you think of scenes from Grand Gaia. Who could possibly live here?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21001_DESCRIPTION":"You can see the castle more clearly as you approach, and it really does seem similar to some ruins you've seen before.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21002_DESCRIPTION":"Did the culture of this world influence Grand Gaia just as the one on Bectas did? Or was it Grand Gaia that influenced this world?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21003_DESCRIPTION":"The gate is right ahead of you. You can tell now that you're close. You're pretty sure you've seen extremely similar architecture on Grand Gaia...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21010_DESCRIPTION":"You were shocked to learn that humans fled to places other than Elgaia during the war with the gods. Are there other cases of this, as well?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21011_DESCRIPTION":"Fearing attack by the Mystical Wolf's minions, the townsfolk keep their doors shut tight. And thus the town itself is overrun with monsters.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21012_DESCRIPTION":"The Mystical Wolf's change is probably related to this land's sealed god. If so, your survey will probably also help to save this world's people.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21020_DESCRIPTION":"Luciana has moved ahead despite Liana's effort to stop her. It seems our presence has had negative effects. You have to catch up to her.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21021_DESCRIPTION":"Luciana believes the legends, and probably thinks the gods are still humanity's enemies. Liana seems terrified of Tilith, too.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21022_DESCRIPTION":"According to Liana, it's not especially cold right now. This is the normal weather all year. Elgaia might seem like a paradise next to this world.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21023_DESCRIPTION":"The snow on the trees sometimes falls to the ground noisily. How did the people of this world survive in such a cold land?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21030_DESCRIPTION":"The three of you proceed along the lake's shore. The lake is frozen in patches, and it seems like a person could walk out onto the ice in some places.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21031_DESCRIPTION":"There was no snow in Tull's world, so advancing through it is a real struggle. You have to walk ahead and pack down the snow.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21032_DESCRIPTION":"The problem with this world is the enemies that hide in the snow and leap out at you. If you get thrown into the lake, you might even die of the cold.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21033_DESCRIPTION":"You're almost to the site of one of the shrines. However, you're well aware from experience that \"almost there\" is a dangerous place to be.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21040_DESCRIPTION":"There's a fantastical scene unfolding in the sky. You want to observe closely, but there's no time if you intend to catch up to Luciana.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21041_DESCRIPTION":"These snowfields seem to be filled with lurking enemies, but with Hatch scouting ahead you should still be able to avoid most fights.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21042_DESCRIPTION":"You can see far across the vast snowfields, but the enemies hide in the snow and ambush you at times. Stay alert for their presence as you advance.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21043_DESCRIPTION":"You're close to the border between the snowfields and the ice lake. Powerful enemies often lie in wait in places like this. Keep your wits about you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21050_DESCRIPTION":"The sealed god of this land appears from nowhere. Beat it and you'll complete your mission here. All you can do now is fight with all you have!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21051_DESCRIPTION":"It seems that the Mystical Wolf was actually this world's sealed god. You need to find a way to win before you fight it again...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21052_DESCRIPTION":"The cold, dry air makes your nose hurt. Reda seems to be freezing, too, but Luciana and Liana appear used to it.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21053_DESCRIPTION":"Enemies attack frequently, but at least it warms you up a bit. It might be nice to fight for yourself under these circumstances.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21054_DESCRIPTION":"The air has shifted. There must be an exit nearby. The sisters say that it's still quite a ways to the polar regions even after you leave this cave.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21060_DESCRIPTION":"You can't let sudden meetings and attacks confuse you. They attacked after determining you were a Summoner of the Summoners' Hall, which must mean...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21061_DESCRIPTION":"The Abel Faction was ahead of you in this world, too. How much information are they getting before the Summoners' Hall does?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21062_DESCRIPTION":"You can't tell how deep the cracks in the massive ice blocks go. All you can do is take extreme care in where you step as you advance.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21070_DESCRIPTION":"Cold air...no, a presence so tense it hurts. This alone tells you the immense power of the sealed god. Just what is this sealed god?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21071_DESCRIPTION":"Although you're fairly used to it by now, things are still harder when your Summoning is restricted. You have to get stronger.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21072_DESCRIPTION":"You restored the power of Summoning on Bectas by fighting the sealed god. Will that happen again if you fight the mystical wolf?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21073_DESCRIPTION":"The frequency of enemy attacks has changed... You have a bad feeling about this. You could be wrong, but it feels like you're being chased somewhere.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21074_DESCRIPTION":"It seems the Mystical Wolf's minions have surrounded the area, but you can't let yourself lose for Luciana and Liana's sakes!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21080_DESCRIPTION":"Rene calls you deep underground, beneath the lake castle. Once inside, you experience a sense of deja vu recalling Bariura in Grand Gaia.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21090_DESCRIPTION":"You see something unexpected as you progress deep into the polar region. It's shocking to see a place so verdant in this snowbound world.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_210_DESCRIPTION":"You've reached the shore, escaping the desert. A calm, beautiful beach awaits you, but you must still be cautious.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_211_DESCRIPTION":"A huge ship is anchored on the beach. It's a pirate ship, and it seems there's no easy way past...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_212_DESCRIPTION":"The beautiful view continues, as do the number of enemies you encounter. Prepare yourself for a water assault.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_213_DESCRIPTION":"The end of the coastline is now in view. A Water Spirit is said to appear around here. How strong could it be?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_214_DESCRIPTION":"You've finally reached the coast's end. A dark forest is visible ahead, but surely something is lurking near...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21_DESCRIPTION":"Continue deeper into the Cave of Flames. Beings who control fire are waiting ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22000_DESCRIPTION":"The sun is warm, and the winds are gentle. The climate near here seems nice. Even the leaves make a pleasant sound.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22001_DESCRIPTION":"You see a band of people in black chasing a woman. You don't understand the situation, but she's clearly in danger!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22002_DESCRIPTION":"Who were those people in black? They might attack again, so you need to get somewhere with better visibility.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22010_DESCRIPTION":"You've heard of warriors called shinobi. Does that mean someone from Ohbanahara became a Grand Gaian hero?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22011_DESCRIPTION":"Seria's decision caught you off guard. She must be growing up. You can't let her show you up, though.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22012_DESCRIPTION":"You're going to help Suzune reclaim the country, but that will probably take more than civil discussions to achieve. Be ready to fight.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22013_DESCRIPTION":"The watery fields around you are apparently called paddies, and they're strangely beautiful when they glisten in the sunlight.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22020_DESCRIPTION":"You've seen many signs of wartime destruction already, but this is the first time you've seen the site of a battle that was only days old...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22021_DESCRIPTION":"Broken swords, shattered armor... You should probably stop looking so closely at the things around you. Suzune's looking pale, too.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22022_DESCRIPTION":"Sakunoshin said that people who dress and cover their faces like the one you just passed are called begging monks. They dress very suspiciously.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22023_DESCRIPTION":"Apparently there's a checkpoint and a city once you get past Calamity Plains. Maybe you should dress like you're from this world to get through it?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22030_DESCRIPTION":"Sakunoshin is unconscious, but you can't leave him behind. For now, try to focus your attacks on the enemy leader and make an opening!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22031_DESCRIPTION":"You got free thanks to the begging monk. If he's helping you, he's probably an ally of Suzune's. Trust him for now and focus on escaping.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22032_DESCRIPTION":"You doubt that the enemy will risk harming Suzune, but you're not sure. You have to escape this castle as soon as possible!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22040_DESCRIPTION":"There's a river down the hill and past the checkpoint. The large bridge over it that seems to lead to a city, and the castle lies just beyond.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22041_DESCRIPTION":"You're fascinated by this culture so unlike that of Elgaia, but you need to hurry to Suzune's rescue. You'll have time for sightseeing later.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22042_DESCRIPTION":"Genba's minions are in position on the bridge, and it won't be easy to get across. You need to hurry and push through it.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22043_DESCRIPTION":"You come to a sudden stop when you sense a powerful foe. You may have been too hasty in this. You need to calm down and stay centered as you fight.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22044_DESCRIPTION":"As expected, you've run into a skilled warrior. But why does this warrior know about the sealed god? You'll have to fight to find out.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22050_DESCRIPTION":"There are too many enemies to count! They did know you were coming, so it's not shocking. All you can do is fight your way through.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22051_DESCRIPTION":"You dash through the chaotic melee, crushing autumn leaves as you go. Get into the castle while the begging monk keeps Kagenui busy!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22052_DESCRIPTION":"You've finally gotten through the maze-like castle walls to the main building. Now you can charge the entrance that Sakunoshin mentioned.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22060_DESCRIPTION":"You're surprised that the floors are soft. It seems like all of the flooring is made of woven leaves. You notice that Sakunoshin is going barefoot.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22061_DESCRIPTION":"The castle doesn't seem to be that big inside. That makes it easy to explore, but the low ceilings make it hard to swing heavy weapons.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22062_DESCRIPTION":"You rush up the steps for a higher floor. The creaking of the stairways informs you that the castle is made of wood.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22063_DESCRIPTION":"Kagenui has caught up to you from behind, and Genba, the enemy leader, is right ahead. But if you make it through this fight, Suzune will be safe.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22070_DESCRIPTION":"Sakunoshin saved your life. That Phoenix Strike is terrifying, but it won't be so easy to use with Sakunoshin around.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22071_DESCRIPTION":"You proceed over a roof made of bizarre tiles. You're so high up you couldn't help but look down. There's no coming back if you fall.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22072_DESCRIPTION":"You've made it far enough to see Raka, but you face more foes than ever. Seria's eyes tell you that she'll handle it, so you keep heading up.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22073_DESCRIPTION":"You don't have time to wait on Seria, so you'll be facing Raka alone. It seems she won't use her Phoenix Strike, but she's too strong to take lightly.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22074_DESCRIPTION":"This should be your last fight in the castle. You can sense more power from the Mystical Phoenix than any other sealed god so far. Give it your all!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22080_DESCRIPTION":"Suzune has asked you to investigate a monster with Kagenui. Sakunoshin also came along for some reason. Will that cause problems?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22090_DESCRIPTION":"Myoukei gave you a letter. When you had Sakunoshin read it, it said to come to this field. What does this have to do with you?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_220_DESCRIPTION":"Your eyes haven't adjusted to the dark since coming in from the coast. Are Karl and the others OK?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_221_DESCRIPTION":"Dark forests like this are usually full of bandits. Is it that they work better in the Dark? Either way, be careful.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_222_DESCRIPTION":"The discomfort you felt in the forests of Mistral is back, but this time it's worse. Could this be the work of a time mage?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_223_DESCRIPTION":"It's hard telling which trees are just trees and not just monsters in hiding. If only you could escape this forest...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_224_DESCRIPTION":"The darkness has lightened. The exit should be close, but there's tension in the air. Surely, the sign of a formidable foe.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22_DESCRIPTION":"You've come far, but there's still no exit in site. There are supposed to be bandits in this area.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23000_DESCRIPTION":"The Abel Faction got here ahead of you, but supposedly you're among the first humans ever to set foot here. No one knows what to expect.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23001_DESCRIPTION":"It seems you're on a vast, flat grassland, but there are stones scattered across the plains. You'll trip if you don't watch your step.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23002_DESCRIPTION":"Despite the excellent visibility, the footing is poor. It's not a great place to fight, but at least the climate is better than some you've endured.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23003_DESCRIPTION":"A gentle breeze stirs the grass at your feet. The birds in the sky seem like they're enjoying it, too. Wait... Are those really birds?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23004_DESCRIPTION":"There's more rubble at your feet now, and you can see a building somewhere far off. Dangerous enemies are often found lurking in areas like this...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23010_DESCRIPTION":"You hide from the magical puppets amid the shadows of the ruins. You don't know what the puppets were made for, but they seem to be combat-ready.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23011_DESCRIPTION":"The ruins nearby are obviously too large to have been for human use. But why are they half-destroyed? Was there a battle here?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23012_DESCRIPTION":"The temperature is still nice, but it's very dark inside the massive ruins. It feels even darker given the light outside, and your eyes won't adapt.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23013_DESCRIPTION":"You've been discovered by the magical puppets. Judging by their response, they don't mean to let you get away. It looks like you'll have to fight.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23020_DESCRIPTION":"You managed to escape from the puppets and arrived at a flooded sector. This section of the ruins looks even more degraded than the others.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23021_DESCRIPTION":"Once you get through the building with water up to your waist, you find yourself walking on muddy ground. You don't want to spend very long here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23022_DESCRIPTION":"The ruins are a jumble, and there are several paths through them. Maybe one of them was easy to use once. You just want dry ground to walk on.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23023_DESCRIPTION":"You agreed to work with the Abel Faction in order to defeat the magical puppets. The plan is to form three teams of two and surround the puppets.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23030_DESCRIPTION":"Just as Reda said, the way past here seems rather difficult. Still, the magical puppets will catch you if you stop to complain.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23031_DESCRIPTION":"You attempt the challenging climb carefully. You don't sense anyone ahead of you. Did those two from the Abel Faction find another route?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23032_DESCRIPTION":"You stretch out to grab a stone, then search for footing amid the waterfall's spray. It's slippery, and you watch each other as you climb.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23033_DESCRIPTION":"Your almost-submerged waterfall climb is finally at an end. It's a major accomplishment, but you feel like there had to have been an easier route.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23040_DESCRIPTION":"You reunite with Grahdens and advance along a sheer cliffside route. It's still extremely dangerous, but much easier than the waterfall climb.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23041_DESCRIPTION":"You advance carefully along the narrowing red cliff route. Reda sometimes takes stone samples from the cliff walls; maybe they're unique to Rokkzalm?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23042_DESCRIPTION":"As you face off against the Abel Faction, more enchanted puppets suddenly enter the fray. You'll have to handle them if you're going after Rahnas!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23050_DESCRIPTION":"You're concerned about Bertz and Lugina, but you have to get back to the Sealed God mission. The cavernous temple before you is utterly silent.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23051_DESCRIPTION":"Supposedly this world itself is a Sealed God, and apparently this temple is its center. You approach with caution as you seek the Sealed God's heart.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23052_DESCRIPTION":"Since they're ahead of you, the Abel Faction has probably already reached this temple. Be careful, attacks could come from any direction.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23053_DESCRIPTION":"This temple is clearly split into bright and dark locations, and it seems this was deliberate. Who, or what, could've built this place?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23060_DESCRIPTION":"You felt someone watching you as you stepped into the temple's heart. Is this world itself watching you?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23061_DESCRIPTION":"The atmosphere is solemn, and you can feel tension building with each step you take. It's definitely connected to whatever lies ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23062_DESCRIPTION":"Mel and Garrett are attempting to hold you back, and combat seems unavoidable. You have to eliminate them both and catch up with Rahnas right away!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23063_DESCRIPTION":"You lost a lot of time fighting Mel and Garrett and now you have to hurry. Rahnas may have already reached the Sealed God's core.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23064_DESCRIPTION":"It won't be easy to face Rahnas unless you can fully defeat the enchanted puppet. It's a powerful foe, but you can beat anything if you try!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23070_DESCRIPTION":"You were investigating a Sealed God signal with Grahdens when magical puppets emerged from the ground. You've got to break their encirclement!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_230_DESCRIPTION":"After escaping the pitch black forest, you entered a vast wasteland. The area is being torn apart by lightning.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_231_DESCRIPTION":"You move forward as lightning strikes down all around you. Beware of incoming aerial attacks.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_232_DESCRIPTION":"You're nearing the center of the wastelands. Did Karl and his team successfully bring down the demon they were chasing?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_233_DESCRIPTION":"There's a temple barely visible in the distance. There's no sign of Karl, what has happened to him...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_234_DESCRIPTION":"A summoned thunder king is blocking the path at the end of the wasteland. You must defeat him before continuing.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23_DESCRIPTION":"Looks like you'll be able to leave this cave soon, but there seems to be something sinister awaiting you at the end.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24000_DESCRIPTION":"Look up and you'll see a myriad of stars twinkling in the blue sky even in the daytime, reflecting the many dragons flying overhead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24001_DESCRIPTION":"Bertz and the Abel Faction's objective is unclear, but as Karl says, one strategy may be to give priority to crushing their plans.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24002_DESCRIPTION":"Looking up at the stars under a blue sky is also something you feel you could get used to. You may come back for stargazing once everything's done.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24003_DESCRIPTION":"Red flickers are visible in the distance. Seems like it's time to say farewell to this hill of falling stars. Look sharp and let's move ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24010_DESCRIPTION":"The gods of Grand Gaia were surprised you came to this world, and perhaps not so surprisingly, you don't seem to be welcome. Prepare for a fight...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24011_DESCRIPTION":"The seal of Alza Masta...the role of the Sealed Gods... Too many things have become obvious. It might pay to reassess all the information.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24012_DESCRIPTION":"You make your way along a fire lit path. The power a Summoner needs to subdue the Pious Emperor Alza Masta...naturally you can't hide your shock.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24013_DESCRIPTION":"If you lack focus, you'll risk falling into a grave of scorching flames. Forget about the conversation a moment ago and concentrate on the battle.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24014_DESCRIPTION":"You have come close to the foot of a mountain that emits lightning. You turn to the Dragon's Flame Tomb and feel a strong heat approaching...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24020_DESCRIPTION":"Lugina appeared to be a little stressed. Perhaps he can see ahead to what will happen if he can't stop Bertz.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24021_DESCRIPTION":"Amidst the flashes of light and resounding thunder, in this place you're no longer able to think of anything other than the Dragon's Flame Tomb.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24022_DESCRIPTION":"As usual it was impossible to know what Bertz was thinking. It may be your imagination, but there looked to be benevolence in his eyes.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24023_DESCRIPTION":"A rumbling sound fills your ears. It's not thunder, this seems to be a roar. A battle with the owner of that voice may be unavoidable.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24030_DESCRIPTION":"A fantastic light is being reflected off the peaceful surface of the lake. This is a place where you want to take your time and enjoy the scenery.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24031_DESCRIPTION":"Not a ripple stirs on the surface, and the view of the surrounding scenery reflected in the water is tranquility itself.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24032_DESCRIPTION":"It's quiet, peaceful...you calm down more than necessary. This won't do. You need to stay alert in case of an enemy attack.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24040_DESCRIPTION":"What Bertz was after...and Rahnas's past. There's no point dwelling on it. Your first priority is to prevent Rahnas from getting hold of power.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24041_DESCRIPTION":"Like the lake, this forest also makes you introspective. It's clear what you need to do now. Stop thinking about unnecessary things.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24042_DESCRIPTION":"Going along this dark trail for some reason makes you recall the paths you've traveled so far. When you think about it, you've traveled many places.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24043_DESCRIPTION":"This forest doesn't have an especially strange atmosphere, yet it feels like you've come to a very faraway place...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24044_DESCRIPTION":"While walking through the forest, you recall your adventures so far and become lost in thought. You need to focus on the battle awaiting you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24050_DESCRIPTION":"Once you've passed through the forest, a majestic temple-like structure appears before you. Could it be something that the gods of Grand Gaia created?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24051_DESCRIPTION":"The temple has comparatively little damage and is well maintained. Maybe those two gods you encountered in this world are taking care of it?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24052_DESCRIPTION":"You didn't expect to come across two Elder Summoners fighting Rahnas! Owen probably won't like it, but back him up as Grahdens instructs.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24053_DESCRIPTION":"Rahnas was an even stronger opponent than you imagined. However, Owen's strength seemed to be slightly superior. If you fight now, you might win.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24060_DESCRIPTION":"No one could hide their surprise at Owen taking a severe wound. He's been treated now, but you can't help but feel the scope of Rahnas's power.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24061_DESCRIPTION":"If Rahnas gains true Summoning power, what does he intend to do with it? Bertz said he wanted to protect Elgaia, but...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24062_DESCRIPTION":"You've let your mind wander again, and that won't do. Clear your head and fix your attention on the battle happening right in front of you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24063_DESCRIPTION":"You've only just now noticed the beauty of this cave. With so much on your mind you're beginning to get tunnel vision. Stay alert.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24064_DESCRIPTION":"You have the uneasy feeling you're being watched from the darkness. To get through the cave, probably your only option is to defeat a powerful foe.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24070_DESCRIPTION":"The power left behind after the Holy Emperor battled Ark in Ishgria lies deep within this place. You don't feel any aggression yet, but...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24071_DESCRIPTION":"You've stopped the Sealed Gods from going berserk on many other worlds. Here that journey will likely come to an end. Just focus on what you must do.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24072_DESCRIPTION":"Rahnas is one step ahead of you. If your power is stolen, a painful battle most likely awaits you. You have to stop him before that can happen!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24073_DESCRIPTION":"Rahnas has gained Karna Masta's power and it's formidable! But remember your battles in Grand Gaia and Ishgria, and seize victory once again!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24074_DESCRIPTION":"The story of the Summoner who continued to fight alongside a goddess gives people hope. You can't let them down in this battle!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24080_DESCRIPTION":"The two gods who were cooperative until now have challenged you to a fight. Best to just comply with whatever is necessary for them to move forward.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_24090_DESCRIPTION":"You didn't expect to come up against Alza Masta again... Could this be the fated outcome of gaining Karna Masta's power...?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_240_DESCRIPTION":"There is a temple bathed in light. Despite it being thousands of years old, it's as beautiful as the day it was built.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_241_DESCRIPTION":"You continue even deeper into the massive temple. You can make out the solemn silhouettes of pegasi standing about.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_242_DESCRIPTION":"You've nearly reached the middle of the temple. You can imagine the days when many would gather at this impressive alter.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_243_DESCRIPTION":"You can feel the enemies growing stronger the deeper you go. Unfortunately, the only way to the Tower of Morgan is forward.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_244_DESCRIPTION":"You reached the temple's innermost area. A mighty swordsman awaits you, and you can surely expect a fierce battle...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25000_DESCRIPTION":"The mission this time is to pursue Mel and Garrett. You never thought that would mean traveling all over Elgaia with Tilith.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25001_DESCRIPTION":"You meet Lugina and proceed into a barren grassland. You never knew there were parts of Elgaia like this. What happened here?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25002_DESCRIPTION":"This is a complete wasteland. It looks as though some massive power once shattered the land. The damage doesn't seem that old, though...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25003_DESCRIPTION":"You thought you knew everything about Elgaia, but it seems this journey will be as hard as the rest. Get ready to face a formidable foe.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25010_DESCRIPTION":"Mel and Garrett are ready for a fight to the end. You can't avoid fighting, even if just to back them off. It's not the first time, but be careful!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25011_DESCRIPTION":"Neither Mel nor Garrett, nor even Bertz would listen to you. There really shouldn't have been any need for combat.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25012_DESCRIPTION":"The area around you is devastated. Lugina said it wasn't due to the demons of Ishgria. But if it wasn't demons, what was it?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25020_DESCRIPTION":"You can't allow the demon to go free. You have to get Mel to stop standing in your way somehow, and hurry after Garrett!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25021_DESCRIPTION":"Mel is coming along complacently. You're glad you didn't have to restrain her, but her behavior seems a bit odd.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25022_DESCRIPTION":"Perhaps it's because you weren't a great student, but you've never heard about any demons appearing here. The information may have been suppressed.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25023_DESCRIPTION":"How many years will it be until this region is habitable once again? You must stop the demon's resurrection, at any cost.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25030_DESCRIPTION":"According to Bertz, Mel is an artificially-created human. Yet you can't help but treat her as a person, and Tilith seems to approve.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25031_DESCRIPTION":"You've seen countless ruins throughout Grand Gaia. Though it seems to have been a while since this place was destroyed, it still feels lively.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25032_DESCRIPTION":"If the demon is revived, more places like this town will come to be. And in Elgaia, it will affect so many people!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25040_DESCRIPTION":"You were shocked to learn that Lugina and Bertz were born in this region. Both probably have terrifying memories of the demon that destroyed it.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25041_DESCRIPTION":"Bertz's desire to prevent another such tragedy is pure. For all that's happened, you can probably still reach an understanding with him.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25042_DESCRIPTION":"You have to stop Garrett's plan no matter what. Countless people will be harmed if the demon awakens. You have to prevent that no matter what.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25050_DESCRIPTION":"Mel says she intends to obey Garrett when he speaks of Rahnas's wishes. Did she choose to do so of her own accord?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25051_DESCRIPTION":"Garrett laid his trap meticulously. All you can say is that you're impressed, given how badly injured he was when he set it up.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25052_DESCRIPTION":"You sense a repulsive presence. It's definitely distinct from the other demons you've faced. You're probably close to where it's sealed; keep moving.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_25053_DESCRIPTION":"You face the demon after it absorbs Garrett's life energy, but you have no fear. You're not fighting for the past. This is for the future.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_250_DESCRIPTION":"You see ruins as you escape from the temple. It seems that whatever existed here before was destroyed by a great power.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_251_DESCRIPTION":"As you proceed, you realize the ruins cover a large area. It must have been a large city before.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_252_DESCRIPTION":"You've come to a plaza in the middle of the ruins. An enormous church embodies the former power of this devastated city.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_253_DESCRIPTION":"Leaving the church, you continue through the ruins. The temple was so beautifully preserved, what could've happened here?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_254_DESCRIPTION":"You reached the ruins' end. The majestic Tower of Morgan stands before you. However, a knight in thick armor awaits...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_260_DESCRIPTION":"Don't let Karl and Seria's wishes go to waste. Ascend the tower quickly and track down Abaddon and Graham!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_261_DESCRIPTION":"This tower is like a gigantic fortress. The spiral stairs that surround its vast outer walls are the only way up...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_262_DESCRIPTION":"Is this only the halfway point? You can still hear the cries from the fierce battle raging below... It's time to hurry.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_263_DESCRIPTION":"Past the halfway point, warriors summoned by Maxwell and Abaddon block the path. There's no turning back now.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_264_DESCRIPTION":"The Stairway to the Heavens has narrowed. You can no longer hear the shouts from the base. You're almost there.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_265_DESCRIPTION":"You've reached the top at last. Continue on and defeat Abaddon and Graham, you can't let Karl and the others down!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2_DESCRIPTION":"Memorize the strengths and weaknesses of each elements and how to trigger the Brave Burst!",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_703_DESCRIPTION":"If you look closely it is obvious this road wasn't made this way by nature alone. It seems a great battle took place in this area.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_704_DESCRIPTION":"The enemies attack quite aggressively. It's as if they're determined to keep anyone from setting foot inside the old capital.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_705_DESCRIPTION":"The end of the road is in sight. However, as you advance the monsters only grow in numbers. You must maintain focus as you move ahead.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_710_DESCRIPTION":"Entering the mountains the sky grows dark. Could it be because of the smoke rising up from the volcanic ash? Dead trees line the path ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_711_DESCRIPTION":"Though not hot enough to burn the skin, the air here is hot. In addition, it is also very thin. Do your best to retain consciousness.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_712_DESCRIPTION":"No matter where you look there's nothing but dried up trees, ash, and rocks. This place has no hopes of ever seeing water. You must get out of hear quickly.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_713_DESCRIPTION":"There are now a lot of paths leading out. It looks like you'll be able to escape the mountains soon, however, you can feel something ahead, the presence of a strong enemy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_714_DESCRIPTION":"The air is dry as always, but it's getting harder and harder to breath. After a short break, an intense roar echoes from afar.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_71_DESCRIPTION":"Light energy is strong against dark, but it's also its weakness. You must plan your strategy here carefully.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_720_DESCRIPTION":"Before you lies a frozen lake. It seems the only way to get to the beach on the other side is to cross over it. Be careful as you proceed forth.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_721_DESCRIPTION":"It is dry here as well, but for a different reason than it was up in the mountains. It's impossible to stand still in this cold. Could Lugina really be waiting here?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_722_DESCRIPTION":"Step after shaky step, you cross the surface of the frozen lake. Looking back, you realize you've made it exactly halfway. How long will the ice hold?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_723_DESCRIPTION":"A chilling wind blows across the lake. Attempting to shrug off the piercing cold, the temperature around you drops unnaturally. What could it be?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_724_DESCRIPTION":"The shore is in view, you can finally get off the ice. Hurry up and get to the shore where there's no chance of slipping.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_72_DESCRIPTION":"A monster with snakes for arms has appeared. Beware, it seems many adventurers have been subdued by its strength.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_730_DESCRIPTION":"You've come to an odd smelling marshland. A strange fog hangs above the water's bubbling bottomless surface. There's no use sticking around here any longer.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_731_DESCRIPTION":"A stomach-turning stench fills the moist humid air. Even when the bad smell breaks, you're left with the choking fragrance of vegetation.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_732_DESCRIPTION":"Monsters leap in attack from both the muddied water as well as the thick shrubs. You'd like to catch your breath, but it seems there's nowhere to rest.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_733_DESCRIPTION":"Suddenly, the miasma from the bog disappears. The air which was once difficult to breath is now fresh and clean. This is likely cause for concern.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_734_DESCRIPTION":"You've made it a long way down the muddy path. The end of the marsh is near, but a remarkably large tree stands in front of you. Surely it isn't an ordinary tree.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_73_DESCRIPTION":"A grotesque swordsman awaits you, and you must overcome him in order to reach the Tower of Mistral.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_740_DESCRIPTION":"Deep black storm clouds fill the sky. Lightning falls in endless waves upon the forest below. There's no way anything could live here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_741_DESCRIPTION":"Your ears begin ringing as lightning endlessly crashes down. The air is thick with the odor of a burnt tree which has been struck by lightning.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_742_DESCRIPTION":"The trees here seem able to withstand exposure to lightning. However, in noticing this it seems you have become lost.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_743_DESCRIPTION":"A paralyzing presence inhabits the forest. You recognize this aura. It seems a warrior you've faced before awaits you once again.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_744_DESCRIPTION":"The sky has become brighter. It seems you might soon be able to escape this strange weather. Is Lugina waiting ahead like he said he'd be?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_750_DESCRIPTION":"You've arrived at the ruins of the La Veda Republic. As ravaged as it is, there are still traces in the rubble of the people who used to live here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_751_DESCRIPTION":"You notice elaborate carvings in the pieces of stone around your feet. The powderized remains of buildings speak of the violent battle that took place here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_752_DESCRIPTION":"Despite how desolate these ruins are, there are no signs of weapons or human remains, and the air is fresh and clean.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_753_DESCRIPTION":"Continuing your search of the ruins, an overwhelming presence stops you in your tracks. Up ahead, a knight of the La Veda Republic lies in wait.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_754_DESCRIPTION":"Burnt houses, crumbling churches. There must've been many residents in a city as large as this. You can't help but hope that the victims have found peace.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_755_DESCRIPTION":"Paris said there should be a shrine dedicated to the God of Light around here. A great force stands before you as if to protect the souls of those betrayed by the gods.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_756_DESCRIPTION":"Arriving at the outskirts of the city you see a shockingly massive bridge. Before you can get to it you must confront the huge dragon on your tail.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_760_DESCRIPTION":"Now that you stand near the bridge it looks a lot bigger than it seamed from far away. You can see an ominous tower far in the distance, but could that be the end?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_761_DESCRIPTION":"Turning back, you see the ruins. Compared to that desolate yet pure place, the bridge is soaked in an ominous miasma. What could be waiting ahead?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_762_DESCRIPTION":"The closer you get to the tower, the more hightened your fear becomes. It's as if the tower itself was infused with some sort of evil energy.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_763_DESCRIPTION":"You've finally made it to the bridge's halfway point. As the enemies are growing stronger, it seems fighting through the second half will only be more difficult.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_764_DESCRIPTION":"Enemies continue attacking, allowing no room for rest. Could they be protecting the power that Paris said was hidden here?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_765_DESCRIPTION":"You're close enough to the tower that you have to look up to see where it ends. It's odd appearance causes a lump in your throught.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_766_DESCRIPTION":"Not much longer to the tower. Lugina still hasn't shown up yet so it's highly likely he's waiting somewhere around here. Proceed with caution.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_770_DESCRIPTION":"There is a thick steel door at the entrance to the tower. Although it is open, you must defeat the monsters around you before going inside.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_771_DESCRIPTION":"Entering inside you notice the entire tower is slightly trembling. You must shake off this bad feeling and focus on the enemy in front of you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_772_DESCRIPTION":"It's a long way to the top, and on top of that there are even more enemies here than outside. What Paris said now stirs uneasiness within you.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_773_DESCRIPTION":"The tower's shaking has grown stronger. The oppressive rythmic sound bears heavily on your chest. What is it that Paris saw here?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_774_DESCRIPTION":"What floor is this? Suddenly looking outside, the once massive bridge now looks relatively small. The top is near, prepare yourself and move forth.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_775_DESCRIPTION":"This could be the final floor. However, you feel the presence of the Four Heroes coming from behind the door leading to the roof. You must defeat them to advance.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_776_DESCRIPTION":"You can hear a ghastly noise coming from the roof. It's the final gate protecting Lizeria's hidden power. Muster your courage and go forth.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_780_DESCRIPTION":"You can feel the immense energy coming from the depths of the lake. But for what purpose does it continue to radiate the surface?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_800_DESCRIPTION":"A thick fog hangs around you as the light stench of rotten eggs fills the air. Be careful as it would all be over if you fell in the hole from which the steam pours.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_801_DESCRIPTION":"It's like a steam bath here, the hot steam making it hard to breathe. It'd be difficult to wear armor travelling through a place like this.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_802_DESCRIPTION":"It's hot. Some cold water would be nice, but there's nothing here but boiling water. You're drenched in sweat, might as well wash off while you're here.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_803_DESCRIPTION":"Pushing aside the steamy air, a scorching hot wind blows in. The parched air instantly dries your once sweat covered body.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_804_DESCRIPTION":"A wind blows in from outside. It's fresh feel invigorates you. However, you sense a powerful thirst coming from where the wind is blowing. It's likely a strong foe.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_810_DESCRIPTION":"All you see goes from steam to snow, and your once steaming hot body is instantly cooled. Worried about Karl, you continue after him.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_811_DESCRIPTION":"Before you notice, your once wet hair and clothes are frozen. Surely you'll catch a cold in this radically changing weather. Brush away the frost and hurry ahead.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_812_DESCRIPTION":"The sprawling snowscape before you is gorgeous, but as much as you'd like to stare this isn't the time to get distracted. You must catch up to Karl.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_813_DESCRIPTION":"You notice that the softly falling snow is starting to cover Karl's tracks. You must find him before you lose trace of him.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_814_DESCRIPTION":"As you traverse the whitewashed landscape, you're surprised by a firm, icy sound. It's the echo of icy gunfire headed your way!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_81_DESCRIPTION":"You've reached the Tower of Mistral at last. This is Maxwell's base inside Mistral. Hurry your way inside!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_820_DESCRIPTION":"Plants that you've never seen before flourish everywhere. Smash your way through this overflowingly vibrant forest just as Seria would expect you to.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_821_DESCRIPTION":"It's hot and humid in this dark forest. It's not as hot here as it was in that steamy cavern, but you're already beginning to sweat.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_822_DESCRIPTION":"Various strange flowers bloom proudly around you. Their mixing smells produce a strange aroma. It's almost...intoxicating...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_823_DESCRIPTION":"From far away you thought you saw a large tree, but now it seems to be coming toward you. Is this an illusion, or is the tree really moving?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_824_DESCRIPTION":"As sunlight begins to peek into the forest, it seems you might be able to get out. Karl and Seria are in the ruins ahead. You must hurry to them.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_82_DESCRIPTION":"This tower reaches amazingly high into the sky. Fearsome monsters await with blood-soaked claws.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_8300031_DESCRIPTION":"A group of maidens barged in here and demanded to use my sacred lab to test each other's strength!! Get in there and appease them so I can return to my experiments!",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_8300811_DESCRIPTION":"It seems a strange creature from Paskua has come to Grand Gaia in search of something. What could it be after, and why?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_8300812_DESCRIPTION":"Although it seemed as if Cotton was after Carrol, it was actually after the eggs she's been collecting. Will she just hand them over?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_8300813_DESCRIPTION":"Carrol and Cotton face off in a battle for the mystical eggs. However, kindness is one of Carrol's most admirable traits...",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_8301001_DESCRIPTION":"You have arrived at the tower where the formidable monster is rumored to be dwelling. It's dark and the cold, still air sends a chill up your spine.",

    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_952_DESCRIPTION":"The cave is even darker than the pitch black seafloor above it. Because of this, creatures of the dark have free reign.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_953_DESCRIPTION":"The stench of death that fills the cave twists your imagination in an ominous way. However, you pray that Lugina is able to rescue Karl.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_954_DESCRIPTION":"Somehow, the cave exhibits signs of human civilization. Could there be manmade structures this far below the sea?",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_960_DESCRIPTION":"You must properly thank Lugina later for securing Karl's safety. Being Mare's prisoner must not have been a cakewalk.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_961_DESCRIPTION":"Your exhaustion from the journey to rescue Karl has worn off. Perhaps the strong human bond between you that Mare loves to mock has its benefits.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_962_DESCRIPTION":"The shrine at the bottom of the ocean has a confusing, unearthly aura. The fact that Lugina was able to find Karl here is impressive.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_963_DESCRIPTION":"Rescuing Karl surely threw a wrench into Mare's plans. If you can attack her head-on and avoid her trickery, you have quite a fighting chance.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_964_DESCRIPTION":"The enemy attacks increase further in ferocity. But their primitive, brute force approach is evidence that you are hot on Mare's tail.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_965_DESCRIPTION":"You have reached the innermost area of the shrine. You will have to defeat the remaining enemies here before you flush Mare out, but do not worry: you are not alone.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_966_DESCRIPTION":"At last you have found Mare in a room at the back of the altar. Show her that she is no match for the human bond you share with your friends.",
    "MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_970_DESCRIPTION":"It is said a ghastly spirit is sealed away deep within this gloomy dungeon home to dark secrets left from the Agni Empire.",
