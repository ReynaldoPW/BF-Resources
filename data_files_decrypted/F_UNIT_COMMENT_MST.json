At the beginning of the great war he headed an ambush on the god army, but towards the end of the war he abandoned his people and tried to escape to another country, causing a confrontation between him and his younger brother, the general of the Agni army. He soon started to lose posterity, but recent studies show that the power he held later in the war was far more superior than any he had held before. Thus, since there is no contest about the fact that he fled to another country, there is a theory which states that he just didn't want to deal with his pesky subjects, but that he planned to come back after some time.",

Though his combat prowess could not match Ultor and Tridon, he overcame tough situations with perseverance and sheer determination. Zedus commanded Hadaron to guard the city beneath Athensphere, for demons and corruption did not only exist in the sea and lands above. With the help of Gazia, he setup the under city defenses. Hadaron treated Gazia like a brother and both were close. When the Augmentation Wars broke out, Gazia turned the underground city defenses against Hadaron's forces, ripping chaos throughout the depths of Athensphere. In the midst of battle, Hadaron adopted the abilities of a Netherhound he had destroyed, growing even fiercer.",

Confused as to why and how his friend had succumbed to such madness, Hadaron set off on a mission to find Gazia. During his long journey across the chaos of the Void, he witnessed the atrocities wrought by Gazia. Augmented with the power of the Netherhound, Hadaron developed the Netherhound's superior stealth and hunting abilities. In time, he discovered that the souls of the beasts infused into the machines still lived on. The Netherhounds somehow looked upon Hadaron as if he was part of their pack. Taking advantage of that flaw, Hadaron established himself as the \"Alpha Hound\", proving himself the strongest amongst them by taking down a great many of Gazia's mechanical beasts. Having subjugated Gazia's Netherhounds, he used them as his eyes and ears, fighting under the cover of darkness. Hadaron became a dreaded phantom capable of attacking from almost anywhere, rapidly destroying key targets and facilities before vanishing without a trace. ",

It's main purpose was actually to serve as an energy conduit that could channel the energies of the void into Zenia, amplifying her powers exponentially. With the Conduit funneling an immense amount of energy into her, Zenia tore open a rift in the Void. But in the process, the artificial intelligence system that had overridden Zenia's control over her own body malfunctioned under the immense energy load.
